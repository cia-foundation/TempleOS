$FG,2$$WW,1$WordStat$FG$ collects statistics from all text files in subdirectories when you call $LK,"WSInit","MN:WSInit"$().  It counts which words follow which other words with what frequency in a big sparse matrix.

It provides auto-complete typing and jump-to-code or jump-to-dictionary_definition functionality.

Tip: If you use consistent var names for items of different classes, you'll usually be able to autocomplete the member vars.  I always use $FG,2$lx$FG$ for $LK,"CLex","MN:CLex"$ ptrs; $FG,2$doc$FG$ for $LK,"CDoc","MN:CDoc"$ ptrs; $FG,2$doc_e$FG$ or $FG,2$doc_ce$FG$ for $LK,"CDocEntry","MN:CDocEntry"$ ptrs, etc.

If you have the raw Project Gutenberg dictionary file, you can generate the SparrowOS processed dictionary files with the stand-alone program $LK,"::/SparrowOS/Adam/WordStat/WSDictGen.CPP.Z","FI:::/SparrowOS/Adam/WordStat/WSDictGen.CPP.Z"$.
