$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Linux TSZ Utility"$$FG$


$FG,2$TSZ [-ascii] filename$FG$

Will uncompress a single file from Linux.  The $FG,2$-ascii$FG$ flag will convert the irregular SparrowOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  (ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)


$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Windows TSZ Utility"$$FG$

$FG,2$TSZ$FG$ is a Windows cmd line program which will assist transferring files from SparrowOS to Windows.  It will also uncompress SparrowOS files you have gotten to Windows.  There are three ways to get files from SparrowOS to Windows -- via CD-ROM, a $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ partition or via a "file partition" you have created with $FG,2$TSZ$FG$ on a Windows partition.


$FG,2$TSZ -expand [-ascii] dirname$FG$:

will uncompress all SparrowOS files with names ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$" in a Windows directory and in all subdirectories.  The $FG,2$-ascii$FG$ flag used in combination will convert the irregular SparrowOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  (ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)  Note: If you pick names not ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$", they will not need to be uncompressed.  You can $LK,"Move","MN:Move"$() or $LK,"Copy","MN:Copy"$() them to a name not ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$" and they will be stored uncompressed.


$FG,2$TSZ -make megcnt partitionfilename signnum$FG$:

will create a file on a Windows partition and fill it with a signature num that can be searched for block-by-block from SparrowOS.  Once some blocks have been allocated by Windows and located by SparrowOS, and if you don't mess with them, you can use them to transfer files between SparrowOS and Windows.  This is a little risky.  It's pretty safe if you create this file on a partition dedicated for this purpose.


$LK,"NonNativeScan","MN:NonNativeScan"$():

is a SparrowOS cmd which will scan for some blocks created by $FG,2$TSZ$FG$ and provide a block num you can use to specify a "Non-LT file partition".  You can recompile OSMain and define this partition or use $LK,"Mount","MN:Mount"$() each time.  You will be asked to provide a drive letter and from then on, you just copy files to that partition, boot Windows and run $FG,2$TSZ$FG$ to extract them.


$FG,2$TSZ -extract dstdirname partitionfilename$FG$:

will copy all files in a file partition to a Windows directory, making them available from Windows.

$BK,1$WARNING:$BK,0$ Do not run a defrag operation on a partition holding a file partition.  If you store files to it after such an operation, you'll ruin data on your hard drive.
