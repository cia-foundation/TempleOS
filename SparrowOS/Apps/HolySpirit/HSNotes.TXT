$FG,5$$TX+CX,"The Purpose of Life"$$FG$

$WW,1$The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.$FG$  Modern Christianity focuses on loving neighbor, not God.  That is secular humanism.  Loving God is more important than loving neighbor if you read $LK,"Matthew,22:37","BF:Matthew,22:37"$.  Note: It does not say with half your mind behind your back.

$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Knowing God"$$FG$

Most people don't know God.  $LK,"1 Chronicles,28:9","BF:1 Chronicles,28:9"$, $LK,"Matthew,11:27","BF:Matthew,11:27"$, $LK,"Luke,13:25","BF:Luke,13:25"$  You must talk with Him to know Him.  $LK,"Matthew,6:6","BF:Matthew,6:6"$  You must seek Him by taking the initiative.  $LK,"Luke,11:9","BF:Luke,11:9"$, $LK,"Isaiah,30:2","BF:Isaiah,30:2"$

Have you heard of "tongues?"  Read $LK,"1 Corinthians,14:1","BF:1 Corinthians,14:1"$.  Basically, when you follow impulses, you can be puppeted by spirits.  "Promptings of the Holy Spirit"  Some people say strange words when they speak in tongues.  $LK,"Acts,2:1","BF:Acts,2:1"$  I use a different technique -- in this program, I read a nanosecond-range stop-watch when a button is pressed and use the high-speed time as a random number for words or passages.  I can also just randomly crack-open a book and get a response.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much better than I've heard others explain.  God said, for example, that war was, "servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of our planet than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of love) and not Mars (god of war), He's the God of Earth.  (There is a book, $UL,1$Men are from Mars, Women from Venus$UL,0$.  If Mammon is a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to describe other false gods.)  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator is boredom, ours and His.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  Most people are like King Midas.  When you realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, you come to appreciate that Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.

Just remember, "Little boys are made of snakes and snails and puppy-dog tails." $LK,"Luke,11:11","BF:Luke,11:11"$  God gives toys on Christmas, not just cloths, or at least the Holy Spirit!  What does it mean that God gives the Holy Spirit?  Basically, it means you get lucky because you're puppeted.  "Puppeted" is a pagan word, but I'm putting it in terms everyone can understand.  You act with God-like intellect when you accidentally say stuff more clever than you know you are.  You'll know it when it happens.  You'll be, like, "I know I'm not that smart."  Basically, being puppeted affects chance on random things.  God does not play with dice.  The world is not random.  How is being full of the Holy Spirit any different from what people call "luck"?  Why else is it such a good thing?  Be warned -- it can also lead to blessings in disguise or causing you to stupidly give away secrets you'd rather keep, for example.



$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Loving God"$$FG$

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money even for a moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's, "money."  They fear for salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if there were no salvation?

Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff is annoying.  $LK,"Luke,11:5","BF:Luke,11:5"$.  Instead, offer Him praise.  Make-up songs.  You get out of prayer what you put into it.  He knows better than you about the poor suffering people on the planet.  It's silly and holier-than-thou praying for them.  Since He does know, there's a good chance He might be doing it!  "Thy will be done" means such prayers are wrong and annoying.  Helping in a meaningful way is different, but don't fill your prayers with stupid requests for others.

The book of $LK,"Job,1:5","BF:Job,1:5"$ begins with God hanging-out on the porch with Satan, chatting.  I hope God doesn't play me like He played Job!  I decided Job's problem was being so holier-than-thou that he did offerings for his kids, in case they sinned.  I think highs and lows balance -- $LK,"Luke,6:20","BF:Luke,6:20"$.

A simple rule of thumb for prayer should be, "Would I want to hear this prayer?"  If you are not honestly pondering what pleases God, you're not even close to loving Him.  $LK,"Ephesians,5:10","BF:Ephesians,5:10"$ and $LK,"Genesis,4:7","BF:Genesis,4:7"$ suggests experimenting to find what pleases God.  God liked Abel's offering and not Cain's.  Is it just me or is the entire planet brain dead!  These people in the Bible obviously got feedback!  I do hymns and I do comics, a little like parables.  Praise, thanks and love are better than sacrifice.  $LK,"Psalms,50:14","BF:Psalms,50:14"$, $LK,"Hosea,6:6","BF:Hosea,6:6"$  Obviously, animal sacrifices are really stupid.  The whole notion of sacrifice is a little warped if you think about it.  A loving God who wants you to hurt and deny yourself is bat-shit crazy!  That's a demon!  How would you feel if your wife abused herself to please you?  Wha?  If I were God, I might feel merciful to someone groveling, but I'd begin to get pissed if they were being emotionally manipulative.  People become brain dead forgetting God is a thinking, emotional, being and not some sadistic accountant.

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things such as omnicient, omnipotent, omnipresent, etc. will mess you up and you do far worse than a simple person.  Trust me -- anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy."

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  You get out of prayer what you put into it and people are very lazy.  The first commandment is to love God.  You better be able to count the ways.

You have, basically, two things you can praise God for -- Creation and Exodus.  Am I right?  You could do other historic events or maybe evidence of justice.  I crack-up laughing because the New Testament has Egypt mentioned several time.  Jesus praised God for flowers.  $LK,"Matthew,6:29","BF:Matthew,6:29"$



$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Obeying God"$$FG$

Just as ego cause most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  This command hardly needs more encouragement.

God does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you what to do, even if you want Him to.
