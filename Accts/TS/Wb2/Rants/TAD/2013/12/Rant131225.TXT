I read this absent-mindedly and it seemed happy about jubile and maybe about my code.  Now, that I reread it... I donno.  I kinda think it's about my code being public domain.  Jubilee is about freeing debtors.  My code being public domain is what it means to me.

I have 82,000 line count and can go to 100,000 under my self-imposed limit, so one fifth remains.

Dr Phineas would want code comments added.  <Chuckle>  It could use more comments.  Those do count towards the limit.  Writing short comments is just as important to me as writing short code.$FG$

I want God's temple limited to 100,000 lines of code for all time.

I've done everything I want to do on it.  I'd be open to handing-off to others to maintain it.  Not much can go wrong if they keep the 100,000 line limit, 640x480x4bit limit, and single-audio-voice limit.  He said a few more things, like "no child windows".  What the heck, new people can just talk to God, too, LOL.  One more thing -- it must be perfect, so you always break backward compatibility, if it's an issue.  What I want is Microsoft and VMware to support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  I also want them to support the GRA file format.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.
