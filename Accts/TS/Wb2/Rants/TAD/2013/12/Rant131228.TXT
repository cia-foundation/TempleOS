The people at OSDev like to brag about how little memory their operating systems use.  If you went to a store and one operating system used 250Meg of RAM and another operating system used 1Gig which would you buy?

The market belongs to people who can make new usage of new technology to do new things.  My new usage is simpler code and lower line-count everywhere.  I load whole files instead of parts of files.  My code is simpler and I can do individual file compression.  File compression does not work on incremental file access.

I broke-out my HolyC lexical analyser for parsing a text file.  It produces a stream of C tokens.  It's nice if you know how to use it.

Someone says income went up for rich, but stayed the same for poor.

99% of the wealth is owned by the top 1%?  We redistribute and everybody has 100 times more money, except the 1%.  Everybody can by 100 cars and 100 houses?

The moral of the story is to look at goods and services, not money in the bank.  If you gave 1 billion dollars to Bill Gates, what would happen?  He would invest it and not change his consumption of goods and services.  If you gave 1 billion dollars as $$1,000 to a million poor people, they would buy goods and services.

The only way to raise standard of living to to be more productive.  If there is 7% unemployment, you might put 3% back to work and 3% more goods and services would exist.  That is the best a politician could ever do.  An engineer, however, could invent something and boost productivity.

I used to buy CD's of music in the 90's.  Now, I go to YouTube.  I am rich!  Cell phones did not exist.  Poor people have technology that did not exist.  How fucken dare you not say life has improved!  Standard of living has gone way up for all people, especially people in Africa who have cell phones.

4:5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

4:6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with
travail and vexation of spirit.

4:7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

4:8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour;
neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom
do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it
is a sore travail.

4:9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their
labour.

I like Jimmy Carter.  It's complicated, though.  No good deed goes unpunished, perhaps.  At the end of the day, the self-confessed sinner might get better results than the saintly one.  Oh, wait.  Highs and lows balance.  Whatever.  It's half a dozen one way and six the other.  If we go in debt now, we pay later, maybe.  Sometimes, the economy expands and you pay your debts for nothing!  See, that bad guy gets-off the hook, sometimes.

It is by grace that we pay our national debt, not works (if the economy expands and no austerity. If technology solves conservation, free pass where we didn't deserve it.)

Desolation is when you world is gadgets and you wake-up empty in desolation.  God is my muse and I won't live in a wasteland.

I have a new sermon -- grace is like the national debt.  No way in Hell will we pay it with austerity.  The only hope is economic growth.  Don't count on it.

An intelligent answer on C over ASM.  So little of what's on OSDev I agree with.

Mine started as 100% TASM.  I wrote a JIT compiler for my command-line.  I converted as much as I could to HolyC.  I optimized my compiler over ten years.

There's a reason the whole world no longer programs in ASM, LOL.

unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.

and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee.
And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the
rock.

and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that
were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his
bands loosed from off his hands.
