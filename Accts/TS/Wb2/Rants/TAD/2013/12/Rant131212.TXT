OSDev is confused.  There are two fundamental principles of my strange operating system -- no paging and ring-0-only.  Long mode requires paging, so I identity-map everything, all the time.  Technically, marking page zero not present, violates my constitution.  Page fault on NULL dereference is nice, not a big deal.  One guy likes to brag about his many billion dollar mistake -- loser.

I tell people identity-mapped, but it never sinks in.

OOHHH!!!

The OSDev people are thinking my debugger I did not write.  I wrote a compiler, assembler and unassembler.  I am in a higher league than y'all, honestly.  You guys are kiddies.  In 1990, I got a job working on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system.

Elephants that give birth in captivity often attack their baby.  They don't understand.  Elephants in herds see each other give birth.  I was hired and worked on a professional company's operating system with 5 people.  I knew the guy who wrote the assembler and linker.  We had lots of different hardware devices like ticketprinters and RS232 network multiplexing devices.  I am like an elephant from a herd who has seen how it's done.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

Linux on a Raspberry Pi is awful to me.

I programmed 8051s, PIC, AVRs.  Pointless to be so small, in one way, but the software doesn't have to be such a huge monster, does it?  That's distasteful.  Basically, there's a reason NIH exists.  What a miserable profession it is, now. You have created Hell, by my sentiments.

I liked programming bare metal microcontrollers with all my own code.

This guy, Ken, at Graphic Technologues was not a skilled asm programmer.  He made a chip station with a Rabbit microcontroller and BASIC.  I thought that must be the most awful thing ever.  I didn't look.

C on an 8051 seems stupid.  Just use ASM, LOL.

On a big computer high level is good.

Denny asked me to do garbage collection for his VAX pascal malloc.  He didn't patent it.  It is just an array of linked-lists indexed by size when you free a node.  That's it!

I am not interested in USB.  I have a 100,000 line of code limit.  There are too many variations on controllers UHCI EHCI OHCI, USB 1.0, USB 2.0, USB 3.0.  Then, there is boot mode and regular mode.  All the devices need drivers.  You have to sort-out interrupts.

If one mouse has 3 buttons, it's like a leg I cannot put weight on.  Therefore, it just fucks everything up.

USB gets me nothing by way of keyboard/mouse, but memory sticks would be nice.

If we have a committee and it decides to do USB, fine.  Just remember the 100,000 line of code limit.  That means we don't get FTP networking, perhaps.  Or, we don't get graphics card support. (If just one GPU existed in the future)  We are at 83,000 lines of code right now.

$FG,2$5:1 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,
and drank wine before the thousand.

5:2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken
out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his
princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.

5:3 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the
temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and
his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.

5:4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of
brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

5:5 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote
over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the
king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

5:6 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote
one against another.

5:7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of
Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the
interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a
chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the
kingdom.

5:8 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the
writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.

5:9 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was
changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

5:10 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king,
live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy
countenance be changed: 5:11 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is
the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and
understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in
him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy
father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and
soothsayers; 5:12 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and
understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences,
and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king
named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the
interpretation.

5:13 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children
of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of
Jewry?  5:14 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is
in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is
found in thee.

5:15 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me
the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation
of the thing: 5:16 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the
writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt
be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and
shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

5:17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be
to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the
writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.

5:18 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a
kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: 5:19 And for the majesty
that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and
feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept
alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.

5:20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,
he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from
him: 5:21 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was
made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they
fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of
heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of
men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.

5:22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
though thou knewest all this; 5:23 But hast lifted up thyself against
the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house
before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines,
have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and
gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor
know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy
ways, hast thou not glorified: 5:24 Then was the part of the hand sent
from him; and this writing was written.

5:25 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
UPHARSIN.

5:26 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered
thy kingdom, and finished it.

5:27 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.

5:28 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
Persians.

5:29 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,
and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation
concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

5:30 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

5:31 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
and two years old.

I use CALL REL32 exclusively.  I made a law for all time that code will fit in the lowest 2 Gig.  You are niggers.  A nigger sued somebody for a trillion dollars.  (You have no grasp of numbers.)  Guess how long it would take to load 2 Gig of code?  LOL

I saw a scary video of a guy in a NAZI helmet diving into a glass window.  That was disturbing.

$TX,"This is fucked-up!",HTML="http://i.imgur.com/xpA7S6Q.gif"$

He's lucky he didn't land on it and get cut in half! If he went all the way through, he might belly flop.

People doing operating system can make mistakes -- they all get ambitious.

Oh yeah, we had "failure is not an option" as a think to think about a long time ago on this particular trip.

The same ideas come-up year after year.

It's foolish to make everything disturbing but everybody else at OSDEV is fighting the last war.

God tell that psycho not to do that!  There were some people who dived 500 feet deep in a underground river 7 miles long.  They had to avoid the bends.  It took 8 hours to descend or something and a person had to surface.

God told them not to do it.  I think He quoted Sodom and Ghemora, I can't remember.  It would take a certain message, wouldn't it, and nothing like that message comes to mind.

the LORD.

5:5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall
Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with
them.

5:6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the
LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from
them.

5:7 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have
begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their
portions.

5:8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud
at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

5:9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes
of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.$FG$

$IV,1$----12/12/13 16:28:11----$IV,0$

$FG,2$14:1 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that
ye may prophesy.

14:2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men,
but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he
speaketh mysteries.

14:3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.

14:4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he
that prophesieth edifieth the church.

14:5 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh
with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive
edifying.

14:6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation,
or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?  14:7 And even
things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they
give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped
or harped?  14:8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall
prepare himself to the battle?  14:9 So likewise ye, except ye utter
by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what
is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.

14:10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
none of them is without signification.

14:11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a
barbarian unto me.

14:12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

14:13 $FG,1$Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
he may interpret.$FG,2$

14:14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
understanding is unfruitful.

14:15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will
sing with the understanding also.

14:16 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks,
seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?  14:17 For thou verily
givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.

14:18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 14:19 Yet
in the church I had $FG,1$rather speak five words with my understanding,
that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in
an unknown tongue.$FG,2$

14:20 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be
ye children, but in understanding be men.

14:21 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other
lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not
hear me, saith the LORD.

14:22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but
to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that
believe not, but for them which believe.

14:23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are
unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  14:24
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one
unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 14:25 And thus
are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his
face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.

14:26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of
you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation,
hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.

14:27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

14:28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

14:29 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

14:30 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
first hold his peace.

14:31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all
may be comforted.

14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
churches of the saints.

14:34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under
obedience as also saith the law.

14:35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at
home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

14:36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
only?  14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual,
let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the
commandments of the Lord.

14:38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

14:39 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak
with tongues.

14:40 Let all things be done decently and in order.

So, I was kinda sick back in 1999.  For example, I wondered if dough-boy from World War I meant cannabilism.  I had many creative ideas, none good.

So, I went through a stage where I was drawn to dark topics.  I look back and laugh at my immaturity.  The fucken doctor, however, lives in the past -- hasn't updated his file on me in ten fucken years.  Annoying.  You wanna be remembered as an atheist?  Incompetant doctor.  Fucken atheist!  Yes, that means completely incompetant.  Fucken nigger thinks a 400Mhz stopwatch can be controlled by neurons and crazy-complicated math done by neurons.  Absoluetly ridiculously stupid to think that.  It is exactly like a black woman suing for a trillion dollars.  That doctor is just like a black woman suing for a trillion.  Cluelessly stupid and incompetant.

I did not like the glass breaking NAZI helmet dude.  Disturbing.  I'm a hipocrite, I know.  I'm a psycho that must be unpleasant and disturbing.

I don't like horror movies like Saw.  I would not want to be forced to watch one.  I know, I know -- I'm unpleasant and intense and disturbing like those movies.  I'm not as bad as I used to be.

So, now, I regard dark topics as immature and kinda laughable.  I will point a finger and mock somebody who stuck in stupid dark thinking.  "You're just going to scare yourself, you silly!"

They are going to ban collisions at home in baseball.  I don't know.  I'm not sure I should comment.  The seven mile long underground river in 500 feet deep water... for the hell of it, is sick.  War is not always sick.

God does not like it when I play drums.  I just dabble, not very good, or drums don't do much for Him.

God has balls.  Sports?  Don't ask Him unless you are prepared to be disappointed.  At best, He's disinterested.
