I have a $LK,"HeapLog",A="MN:HeapLog"$() utility that hooks into MAlloc() and Free().  It displays memory which has not been freed.

To make HeapLog() function, I allocate structures from a 3rd Party heap to keep track of each entry in the heap under test.

Originally, a heap required a task if you wanted to free it at the end and return it to the system.  Then, I created independent heaps.
