Catholicism in practice is helping the poor.
Protestantism in practice is clean living.
Ancient Judaism in practice was making offerings to God.
Religion comes from the occult, not philosophy.

Modern Christianity is secular humanism -- not centered on God and they don't do occult miracles.  Solomon's temple had an oracle.

What kind of offerings should we do?  God wants praise, not thanks.
