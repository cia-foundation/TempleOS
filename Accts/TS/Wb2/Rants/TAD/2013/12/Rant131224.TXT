* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

I thought about my parents who watch TV and go to casinos all day.  They could be doing offerings and talking with God, perhaps making hymns.  If all it takes to talk with God is coming-up with entertaining conversation as an offering, it's tragic that all the old people in the world are wasting away when they could be talking with God!

God's temple will be limited to 100,000 lines of code for all centuries.  If the world settled on one GPU it could have 640x480 16 color GPU support, maybe the manager decides to ask God again.  Performance is not everything.  The 100,000 line of code captures the general idea -- we want it transparent for kids looking at the code.  NonGPU graphics are not magical, but neat, though crappy.

I also said it must be kept perfect by always breaking backward compatibility to achieve perfection.  If the users do not use 3rd party stuff, it just means everybody maintains their own code.

I forgot to discuss how we interpret.

We take God's passage out of the Bible context and put it into our topic of conversation context.  (We do offerings so we can get responses.) The original context, of course, still matters, but we are usually more interested in what God is saying in today's conversation.

God affirmed the low-number of color limit.  If you ask yourself, "How could He say 16 colors?" when we picking a Bible passage, we got a pretty clear answer.  "high places with divers colours."

I can have God pick random words, of course, but we have actual NIST proof of what He said on the record.  It is one batch of numbers every 60 seconds, so if you check the times, it's impressive.

The other thing God said was "children pass through the fire"  I interpret that as... have a kid do a Qt or DirectX application or whatever.  When I was a kid.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I don't want war.  I don't want all potentially harmful things removed.  I don't want a life obsessed with health.  It is not living to constantly think about healthy living.  That is existing.

I mostly just want my demands.  People are worried about a lot of things -- drones, assassinations, pedophiles, mafia money laundering, Chinese&Iranian aircraft-carrier killers, laser guns.  I just want God's Temple and instructing people on offerings.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP"$
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP"$	:1004
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  $LK,"DCSave",A="MN:DCSave"$(), $LK,"GRAWrite",A="MN:GRAWrite"$(), $LK,"DCLoad",A="MN:DCLoad"$(), and $LK,"GRARead",A="MN:GRARead"$().  $LK,"::/Kernel/Compress.CPP"$




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

One time, I asked God what pleased Him most about zoos.  "Dignity"  It's amazing -- all animals great and small have a sense of dignity.  That is either really important for evolution or God just put it ther because it's neat.

Perhaps, a magnificent beast like a polar bear has no dignity, playing with beach balls in a pool.  The poor bear.

I wish I could delete the FAT32 code and the ISO9660, and make it just RedSea filesystem.  That would make me happy.  It would become a beautiful delightful thing.  It's slightly crippled in a way that makes it nonthreatening.  The filesystem does contiguous files.  Trust me -- contiguous-only files are true to the spirit of this operating system.  Delightfully simple.  Obnoxiously simple, like trivial solutions in math.

I think I need VMware to support RedSea, right now, before I can get rid of FAT32.

I will have one-block-per-cluster.  Just shut-up about blocks not 512 bytes (layer makes the new drive look old, anyway).
Just shut-up about computers with multiple chip multiprocessing!

I know!  We can get rid of LBA28 bit and just have LBA48 bit.

God's temple must be perfect.  My notion is that we don't want multiple drivers for the same hardware class.

It's sad we don't get solid-state USB drives.  CDROMs are cheap and nice.  I back-up everything to a DVD every 4 days or less, usually.  If you can't fit, I won't judge you.

I wonder if VMware with Intel's help could do faster IN/OUT instruction timing.  That'd be wicked.  Sigh.  Can't match DMA, but do pretty good.

Just a heads-up.  Sometimes, you take these ridiculously out of context and a intensely serious one becomes funny.  New creature might be  IN/OUT instruction timing changes.  I wouldn't be surprised if God's temple wasn't mandatory.  I use Windows programs or just randomly opening a book to consult God.  I have never said the official temple was exclusively the only place to consult.

I figure the temple is just about the same purpose as Solomon's temple.  It's a beloved shared common virtual location, a focal point for a community.  Nice place for kids to play, too, making games and horsing around with computers.  I hope the music doesn't prove too limited.  God said "Single audio voice".  Perhpas we get HD down the road, but with simple API.  I already did HD.  I can't tell you the joy of how simple PC Speaker is and how much joy I get from just PC internal Speaker.
