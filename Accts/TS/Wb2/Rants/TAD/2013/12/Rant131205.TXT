I don't want Kevin anywhere near me.  He is a working-man labor union guy who thinks himself just as good as a white collar guy.  A millwright is pretty skilled, but I'd guess he doesn't know trig, for example, except maybe he passed a simple test and that was the hardest thing.

I have a master's in electrical engineering.  That is higher rank than computer science, but not up with math and physics.  You didn't know there was a rank?  Psychology is the lowest rank.

It was much more work to do man certified rockets, would you guess ten times more work?

We are not doing man certified rockets.  DOS and the C64 had reset buttons.

We are making a 100,000 line of code home computer operating system used for the same tasks as a Commodore 64 but modern.

If you plan to support 5 screen flight simulators with buttons and knobs and surround sound with twelve speakers and dual chip CPU's with RAID...  The whole thing gets massivly over-engineered.  For them, failure to meet a task is not an option.  For us?  We say, "Ours can't do that, guess you'll have to use Windows or Linux."

If you support some hard drives or GPUS that have feature ABD and others that have CDE and others that have ADE, it gets all fucked-up and you have a hellacious API.  Not only that, but all you applications have to be clusterfucked, so they are just like rewriting for 5 different computers.  A single game is like 3 complete games and you wonder why you bundled them in the first place.

1) It can crash
2) We can say "no, use Windows"
3) We do not support divergent hardware.

Ours is at least two or three orders of magnitude simpler, with this vision.

When you get older, you get wiser.  If I say, "God talks."  A couple of minutes later, you say, "There is no reason not to do stem cell research."  A wise person says to themselves, "she must be an atheist because right after I said 'God' she reacted with the traditional anti-god position."

A wise person starts reading between the lines... everywhere... sometimes they go to far and get crazy, but maybe that's what the spiritual realm is?   If the radio says something, they read between the lines, like it's talking to them.

I fill the screen with a simple test pattern.  It take 85% of the CPU in VMware and 16.6% natively.  That's for changing the image 100%.  Normally, it doesn't change 100% every frame, so it's not as miserable as it sounds.

The 640x480 4 bit plane mode might be old and extra slow -- writing to 0xA0000-0xBFFFF.

VMware is nice most times, but I really do want native mode.

Some people are doing higher resolutions.  They are nuts without GPU support.

Beleive it or not, however, in my flight simulator it is my projection and fill routines that take the CPU, not bandwidth transfer time to the graphics chip.

So, I can't really grumble.  If it is my calculation code, not the transfer, I'm happy.  What do you expect when not using a GPU?  I keep telling people there's a really good reason they make GPUs, but they won't listen.  It is hard to understand because Doom and stuff make it seem like much much better should be possible.

It would be cool to get better performance, even a custom GPU.  God's temple will be around a thousand years at 640x480 16 color.  They could do a GPU driver once all systems have the same GPU in 20 years? (If many GPUs in market, too many lines of code) <Sigh>  The caretaker might choose to keep it nonGPU, since it is open for inspection and tinkering.  Multicore is fun.  If you use a GPU, then multicore is pointless, almost, except for calculating PI or something.  That's probably not paralizable.

Normally, God is not being prophetic when He says stuff, in this venue.  Mostly we just enjoy His company.  Obviously, He could decide to do stuff for real.  You know... there are good reasons to take Him seriously.  Unless you don't realize IT REALLY IS God, overreaction is the problem, not underreaction.

I haven't played a new game in 13 years.  I stay busy entertaining God, LOL.

I remember games I liked, now I don't like games.  I know I really liked games.  What's strange is thinking of younger people, today.

I was 9-12 when ATARI was big.  If I had been 25, they might have been too simple and stupid.  I was just the right age to ride the simple games in time all the way up until they got photo-realistic.

When I see modern games, I realize people think I'm ridiculously pathetic.  Some people might immediately fold the company -- what the Hell are you thinking, loser?

I'm in some kind of prison, or something.  I don't know.  Anyway, it's God's temple and has value as a transparent, modern horsepower, clean and elegant system, but mostly I have to emphasize it's God's temple.

As a philosopher who doesn't know... what would kids think of M.U.L.E?

I might think all games are big production games, but what I think without knowing is there are many thousands and thousands and thousands of games, big and small.  Steam sells twenty big games for $$5.

If I get some followers who enthusiastically like my philosophy, I might tell them it's okay to continue buying Windows good-graphics games.  What we offer is computer enthusiast fun.  In a nutshell, think about this: The Commodore 64 user manual told how to draw graphics by calculating binary number bitvalues for sprites and entering them into a BASIC program.

There is nothing more visceral then adding 1+16+64 for a bit pattern, typing a BASIC data statement and seeing the sprite when you are done.  Bill Gates is going to say, "I have a web app that does just that!"

God said it was our ancestrial land and VMware was like being moved on a resurvation.

Mine is plenty visceral, but with 8x 64-bit 3.6Ghz cores, it's not pathetic!

OSDev say releasing source is because it's broken.

I am humble.  I chose 640x480 16 color.  I do PS/2 keyboard/mouse.  I do ATA/ATAPI PIO without interrupts.  I have chosen the most modest hardware because I really really want it to work for people -- I learned that on 5 computer upgrades, 4 didn't go without a hitch.  Compatibility is the only thing that matters.  Without interrupts, it stands a better chance of working -- by all means, don't use interrupts, poll if you can.  I am not an arrogant fool who charges in and makes an OS that works on one in ten computers.

I give source, but you cannot compile it unless it boots.  In other words.  You cannot fix it if it doesn't boot.  You can make an ISO distro on a machine that does boot to patiently debug one that doesn't.  Fuck that.
