Back in 1992, I did a scheduler for a 8-bit microcontroller for a class.  We made a linked list of tasks sorted by when they are ready to run.  Then, set the timer to interrupt based on the time of the head of the linked list.

If you want that, use Linux.

My highest goal is simplicity, not efficiency.  My company is "Trivial Solutions".  My highest goal is low line count and conceptual simplicity.

I have one set of task pointers that go in a circle ordered by WINDOW_Z_STACK.  I do not want another set of pointers for ready-to-run.  I keep my timer at a fixed 1kHz interval and I go in a circle around the tasks and quickly skip unready tasks by checking their wake-up time.  I skip them if they are waiting on a message.

When you send a message to a task waiting on a message, you just clear the bit saying "waiting on a message" and it runs the next time it is checked.

Compitabilty is the number one, in fact, only concern that an OS must deal with.

Interrupts are an incompatibility source.  I'm more than happy to pay a performance penalty polling hard disk and CDROM, to avoid incompatibility problems.  It makes the code simpler, too.

I am not doing PCI devices, not doing USB.

I wrote a 64-bit x86_64 compiler and an assembler and unassembler.

I wrote full support for making ISO files.  I have a CDROM bootloader.

I have a Hard Disk boot loader.  Boot the ISO file to install onto harddrive.

Mine works with BIOS, not UEFI.  Not going to do UEFI.

Mine supports ATA/ATAPI PIO.

Mine supports 640x480 16 color VGA.

Mine supports PS/2 keyboard/mouse in USB legacy mode.

I am not doing networking.  Mine is intended to dual boot and be used for fun stuff, as God's temple.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.
