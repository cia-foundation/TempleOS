* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.

Not a single person on this planet gets-it.

The number one rule is fewer lines of code is better.  The best thing you can do is find an obnoxiously expensive way to simplify and reduce lines of code.  The company is called "Trivial Solutions."  You must learn what this term means in differential equations to understand the Zen of TempleOS.

Linux is full of complicated code for many architectures loaded with #ifdefs.  We do the opposite -- one architecture.

Linux builds seven levels of tiny function calls to place port I/O code miles and miles below.  People pride themselves on abstraction layers, the more the better.  Wear three condoms at least, why don't you?

Your assignment is to do what I did when I searched for IDE port usage back in 2004 in Linux.  I did not know it was ATA and I did not know ATA specs can be had.  You will have to navigate your way down through 7 levels of functions to find the actual IN and OUT instructions.  Why bother calling it open source if it's, practically, to hard for mortals to understand.

I decided "I want minimal abstraction."  The commodore 64, the users directly did hardware.

Normal rules don't apply.  Normally, code defects are fixed.  When you have a budget of 100,000 lines of code, suddenly, you say "fuck it" it's not important to .. out of professional pride... go to extreme measures to fix rare defects.


All file I/O is done on whole files, for the most part.  We are NOT a general purpose operating system because we can tell people to use Windows or Linux.

There is no point if it become indistinguishable from Windows or Linux.  Catch yourself when you start making TempleOS more like Linux or Windows.  Think Commodore 64, not main frame.

Most products are doomed to die because people keep adding shit to them and they soon become hell-holes, and they do not break compatibility.  We have a 100,000 line of code limit for all eternity, and we keep it perfect.

On the Commodore 64, that game probably had an artist and a professional programmer or two.  It probably took 6 months.  Also, maybe, a lot of game design and testing and refining went into it, I don't know.

As disappointingly unambitious as this sounds, our modest goal is to have as many teenagers able to recreate this game in their spare time in high school, as possible.

If backward compatibility is broken, what happens?  All the little teenagers have to modify their code.  These projects are all small scale, it's not like we are targeting million line count packages that would be a huge loss if scrapped.

I used to say our goal was "programming as entertainment."  A triple AAA game provides 80 hours of value, right?  The commodore 64 user's manual that came with every machine told how to make sprites by adding bit values of binary numbers and put them in DATA statements in BASIC programs.  That was the entertainment!

>*gr_font(U64 *)['A']=0x5555AAAACCCC3333;

Amusing, huh.

Perhaps a teenager will not make a whole game, just screw around and modify and poke around.  We provide lots of stuff to poke around at.


The new focus is not programming as entertainment, but God's temple.  We serve as a common focal point for God's people where they can do offerings.  The Jewish temple was a community focal point for gathering and doing offerings to God.
It had an oracle, we have an oracle in AfterEgypt.

You must do an offering before inquiring at the oracle, this is a covenant.

* $FG,2$One memory map$FG$ for all tasks on all cores with virtual addresses set equal to physical.

* One platform -- $FG,4$$TX,"x86_64",HTML="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"$$FG$ PC's, no 32-bit support.

* No security.

* No networking.

* Least (greatest) common denominator hardware support.  Mostly, one driver for each device class.  I can't be in the business of different drivers.  Compatibility is the greatest challenge for PC operating systems.  Disk code does not use interrupts, avoiding compatibility risks.  PS/2 keyboard/mouse is used instead of USB, also more compatible.

* $FG,2$640x480$FG$ 16 colors.  Updates whole screen at 60 fps, optimized for full screen games where "invalid rectangles" are counter-productive.

* One font, 8x8.  Text and graphic layers done in software with text normally on an 8x8 grid.  It can run in Text mode if graphic initialization fails.

* Compiler extends all values to 64-bit when fetched and does only 64-bit computations intermediately.  Assembler has minimal 16-bit support, good enough for compiling boot loaders.

* No object files.  Linking can be done at $LK,"Load",A="MN:Load"$() time for $FG,2$AOT$FG$ modules, if you insist on not using $FG,2$JIT$FG$.  Modules have imports and exports.

* Whole files are processed almost exclusively, allowing compression.

* One language and compiler for command-line, scripts, and code.

* One editor/word processor/browser for the command-line window, source code, documentation browser, dialog forms.

* No child windows.  One window per task.  Buttons are widgets, not child windows.  There are child tasks, however.

* No distinction between "thread", "process" or "task".

* The $LK,"Scheduler",A="FI:::/Kernel/Scheduler.CPP"$ is mostly for home systems, not servers or mainframes.  The focus task is all important.  Disk requests are not broken-up, so sharing is bad, however.

* $LK,"MultiCore",A="FI:::/Doc/MultiCore.TXT"$ is done master/slave, instead of $FG,2$SMP$FG$.  Core zero explicitly assigns jobs.  Locks are present allowing multicore file, heap, and hardware access, though.

* $LK,"Music",A="MN:Play"$ is done with an elegant one-voice notation.

* All tasks have a heap and a sym table.  Scope is that of environment vars in other operating systems.  As text is typed at the command line or you run programs by $FG,2$#include$FG$ing them, the syms go in the table.  If a sym is not found, the parent task's table is checked.  The father of all tasks has the API syms you'll need waiting in it's table.  No need to $FG,2$#include$FG$ headers.

* No need for namespaces -- scoping occurs automatically based on task symbol table hierarchy with the $FG,2$Adam task$FG$'s symbol system-wide global.
