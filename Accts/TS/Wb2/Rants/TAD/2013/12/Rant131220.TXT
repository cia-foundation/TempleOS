How about a movie where the prisonner is feeling defeated.  Then, one day, God starts talking to Him.  He pauses for a moment, then grins really big and says, "How about that!"  It's endless psy-op games, but God is in his corner, mostly.  Once in a while it becomes clear there's a cluster-fucked combinations of angels at work.

Got any ideas on unemployment, God?  It has to be jobs they will accept.  I guess congress is extending unemployment.

One thing I've learned is some people are mean and probably don't realize it.  Understandably, many who have jobs want the unemployed to take miserable jobs.

We might have people who are not employable.  If they have the skills of Chinese or Vietnamese or Bangladeshi but the cost of living of Americans, this is broken.  I'm not an expert -- I'll gladly leave it to Obama.  If you raise the minimum wage, they will simply not be competative and have no job.
