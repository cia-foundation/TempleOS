My inspiration is a Commodore 64, not a 1970's mainframe.  I spent a lot of time learning about computers and horsing-around.  It's strange to think about it this way, but how many hours of entertainment did I get from poking and prodding the system out of curiosity?  You can get entertainment without accomplishing anything, just looking around and exploring.  I loved this book:  $TX,"Mapping the Commodore 64",HTML="http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/project64/mapping_c64.html"$.  That book was just for Uber Nerds, but the $TX,"User's Guide",HTML="http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_users_guide/c64-users_guide.htm"$ is shocking today.  Look at that!  It tells how to make sprites by adding bit values together and putting them in DATA statements.

Can you believe that!!!?  The fucken user's manual that went to every user made it normal to add bit values to make graphics!  Every user was entertained by tinkering in ways they ban you from now and mock.  But we liked it!  It was fun because it was cutting edge, true, but it was also fun because it as on bare metal.  This is not a good analogy, by pyrotechniques are fun -- fireworks -- yeah the professional firework shows are okay.

Guess what?  The fucken CIA and Microsoft is saying "Of course you don't need personal fireworks.  Those are pathetic.  What you need are the professional shows."  If you say you want your personal fireworks, they call you a terrorist and mock you because personal fireworks are so much less grand than pro shows.  Why would anybody want personal pathetic fireworks?

Normally, with switch() you have a run-time check before jumping to make sure it lies with-in the jump-table.

A jump-table might have ten entries 0-9, for example.  Switch(12) would load a value beyond the table, so you don't want that!  I have a nobound_switch() if you know it will never be larger than the smallest-to-biggest cases.

I value consistency.

My compiler has a rule on it's code -- if a value finds a way into a register, it has been promoted by sign extension or zero extension.  All operations are done on 64-bit values.

Therefore, my compiler is best with 64-bit ints in the first place.  When I have a function return value or argument, I tend to make it 64-bit no matter what, so that my compiler does not waste byte sign or zero extending.

Always use 64-bits, signed, unless it physically breaks.  Literally.  Even when it's wrong to use signed, use signed unless it breaks.

I value consistency.  I value not having to make decisions.  Instead of agonizing over whether it should be signed or unsigned, use signed.

BASIC is a language with one int size, in theory.

You fucken liberals love obnoxious lavish inefficent stuff that goads old programmers, panzie-ass inefficient functional languages, why don't you like my 64-bit signed-int policy?

Sometimes a king is required.

TABS are 8 columns.

If I can save you the agony of making a decision by being king, I will.

Use 64-bit signed ints unless it breaks, or it's a data structure.

him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

12:21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

13:1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

13:2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou
shalt have praise of the same: 13:4 For he is the minister of God to
thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he
beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a

I have two thpes of spaces, soft and hard.  Use hard spaces inside quotes.  I have a tool that converts beginning, middle and end spaces to tabs and removes trailing.  I run it every time on all my source code.  one tab instead of 8 spaces is faster for the compiler LEX and faster uploading and downloading.  It pays-off over the centuries.

I don't care about electricity -- whole different discussion.  I adjust building thermostat, it's 70% of energy usage.  Consipracy of silence.

God has to make sure they don't go a month without food.  Jesus said this about bird.  That makes me very worried when I see bears, especially polar bears!

I think about those years working on Ticketmaster VAX operating system.  We took great satisfaction in building things that would last forever.  Little did we know it was all a waste.  I'll bet the people at Microsoft no longer feel they are building permanance.

Permanance makes all the difference on moral.  If it only lasts a few years, there is no moral.  Linux is feeling immortal.  Must be complete shit if they did not break compatibility and they support all that shit.  If it's complete shit, it almost as bad as doomed in 3 years.

Microsoft will last, but it's not the same as before phones and consoles.  It's kind of depressing.  I get depressed when I see stuff like Zoo Simulator -- some second string game, one of hundreds, that took lots of work.

I guess the world is happy with tiny successes, instead of big market successes.

I have no idea -- the market.

A band might have imagined good-old-boys were in charge of labels... CIA and stuff.  I worked at Ticketmaster when Pearl Jam tried to go around.  I'm conservative and all authority comes from God.  So, I sit and wonder if the gate-keepers blocked Pearl Jam.  Who knows... all Hell could break loose.  What if these crazy leftist militants that Obama encourages... what if they would start riots and race wars?  What if the FBI prevented race wars in the 1960's?  They made Arron Swartz commit suicide.  Any reasonable person tries to estimate what would happen if we got rid of the scumbag pigs.  Mexico?  Africa?  One has to sit down and figure-out who's right and who's evil by being reasonable.  Crazy fuckers are scared of drones and... they go balastic on 3D printers.  3D printer freak the shit out of the FBI.  I worked on a 3D printer in 1996.  God damn, the FBI made Xytec, a front company to hire me and study me.  There are many FBI people employed just on me 24/7.

Anyway, Pearl Jam did Jeremy, about a kid.  That's kinda weird in modern light with anti-kid pedophilia-hating pro-homo anti-birth pro-abortion population-reduction liberal regeme.  Jeremy is weird -- about a kid.  Can you believe that show Full-House.  WTF!  Even at the time, I thought that show was WTF!

You need to tell people what's uncool.  My brothers told me falcetto in singing is for fags and women singers are... pornographic, basically.  there's awareness of pedophilia, now, and no sane person is going to sleep-walk into Korn or Japanese anime.

Intel is being nice with a SSD.

<sigh>I should probably not write the FAT block every time I do a disk operation. LOL  The adults have arrived.  God said He might be disappointed with my 60 fps refresh scheme, wastes power, too.

I might not recompile just for fun, so much, LOL.  It's kinda like being around an 80-year-old and obsessing on death.  They're not gonna die for a while.

One lesson I would teach people is that perfect and infinity are very different from imperfect and finite... not so much in how much difference they make, but in how people think about them.  After-all, there is virgin and not-virgin...  it's not fair, but they don't distingish that much beyond that, just like drugs.

I got used to not being competative for database servers and stopped thinking about that.  (My disk I/O was not competative.)  "Good work if you can get it," is what they say about people who don't have to compete.  I don't think it's in the cards to make it a server OS.  The exception would be a transparent simple server for... extremely conservative own-your-business nuts, maybe like my brother Kevin for his book store.

A data base where you put records in disk blocks and number the blocks by account number... might be fun, like do-it-yourself home improvement.

We don't have networking, though.

Like a moth to light, I am drawn to evangelizing. Am I supposed to keep my mouth shut?  Angels might tell me, "Everything's under control."
