When I was taught to estimate assembly language instruction times, we counted the memory fetches for the instruction and memory fetches for the operation.  I got to thinking about MMU's with paging and it takes 4-5 memory fetches to look up all the levels of paging for each access!  It doesn't take a genius to figure-out no paging is faster!  (It's required for long mode, however.)

Today, I moved my compiler code out of low memory and it, now, executes faster.  My lowest 2 Meg range of memory has 4 level paging with 4K pages, but upper memory has 3 level paging with 2 Gig pages.

I hate the concept of generating content ahead of time.  I hate multimedia.

I did sound for SimStructure, a Windows game.  Compared to the Commodore 64, sound in Windows is difficult, unless you just want to play a WAV file.  That pisses me off.

I want no multimedia, pregenerated content in my operating system.

I don't plan to support networking; I plan to always have it a special purpose secondary operating system.  I wouldn't mind FTP if someone added it.  We are keeping the 100,000 LOC limit, however.

If you are not doing "multimedia", and are doing 640x480 16 color VGA, you will never run out of memory.  If you are doing "multimedia", you will immediately run out of memory.

Basically, I told you what my vision was -- a souped-up, 64-bit Commodore 64.

Yes, it has multitasking, but has no fancy algorithms for sharing the drive.  If one task loads a 20 Meg file, nobody can use the drive until it's done.  The target is video games and in a video game you don't typically have two tasks fighting over the drive, maybe just one.

I have thoroughly tested and proved that it works for what I intended.  Study what I have done and you will see what its good for.

Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel

Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.

Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear him thither.
Page and monarch forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps, my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing

The Bible says to "sing a new song" about 7 times.  I like new songs.  I listen exclusively to talk radio because my station is hard to retune.  therefore, I haven't heard any new music in 3 years.  Sometimes, I wonder if Rock music has been exhausted -- no newness.  Sometimes, I wonder if exodus from traditional BIG music sources to tiny ones has removed the gatekeepers and everybody is too stupid to know they're listening to crap.

I learned something while writing hymns and generating random songs.  I learned to distinguish good from bad music.  I used to listen to lots of awful music.  Actually, it makes a difference if it is new to you.  I remember I really liked that Korn song when I first heard it.  Now, I don't know, but it doesn't please me.

God likes wit... in theory.

One time, I was confessing my sins.  God said, "Excess contricians wearysome."  that was profound.  I came-up with the notion that justice is unchangable and should be left-out of your relationship with God.  You probably want God not to punish you.  Just enjoy God's company.  Jesus said, "forgive us as we forgive."  Shucks, that's nothing but plain-old eye-for-eye justice!  It's not pleasant forgiving, sometimes.

I posted the link to the Pogues.  I don't know if I am being observed and what is known and not known.  This web page gets really really long, very quickly.

Saw a story on Chinese women and marriage.  Nobody wants the most desirable.  Maybe, you don't want to be lessor party all your life.  I have no idea.  I got no money and the doctors make me impotent.  Life is simple.

I saw but didn't read a story on Linear Algebra.

I could says a lot of rambling, but I don't have any strong opinions to say about linear algebra.

How about God say something about the kernel of Linear Algebra.

offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place
every year with blood of others; 9:26 For then must he often have
suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of
the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself.

9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the
judgment: 9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many;
and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time
without sin unto salvation.

10:1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the
very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they
offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

10:2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that
the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of
sins.$FG$

I did a 3D space ship.  I wanted to draw its shadow.  My graphics API routines all support 3D transformations with a 4x4 matrix.  I asked myself how I was going to draw the shadow.  I need a transformation to project 3D onto flat, I thought.  A 3D to 2D projection.  Guess what?  It already is a 2D projection.  I just played around with a few angles and made a solid black image.  I would have to do some hard thinking to intentionally draw a shadow and not just randomly pick a transform.

In theory, I know an awful lot about Linear Algebra and Transformations -- it was fundamental to about 5 of my courses.  $TX,"ASU Transcripts",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/files/ASU_Transcripts.pdf"$

I asked God how He was different from Santa Claus.
God said He didn't mind if we beat each other to a pulp.

The part about picking-up sticks profoundly grim and sobering and intense.

I'm feeling happy and uncompetative.  Meds, I guess.

Bill Gates never misses an opportunity to assert his position.  I think he should let opporunities pass, now and then.  I'm not an expert.

I decided IQ is judged on the stupidest thing you say.  It's okay if you don't impress people, but whatever you do, avoid anything stupid.

things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and
scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

8:32 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to
rebuke him.

8:33 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest
not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.

8:34 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny

shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save

My bachaelor's degree was computer systems engineering.  I had 5 asm courses, but no theoretical computer science, not even one algorithms course.  I worked 20 hours a week for most of my school and got a master's in electrical engineering.

Whatever you do know, is something you don't know.  I don't know the INternet, but I do know systems programming.  My generation learned 6502 asm for C64 & Apple II.  We all then learned real mode 8086 asm programming.

Everybody left behind programming in asm to the past.  I wrote a 64-bit assembler and compiler, so I had to learn all the quirks.

I made this quiz to show-off my x86_64 credentials.

I don't know modern CPU architecture on instruction pipelines and stuff.  I just made my compiler make pretty code that made me happy.  I picked size over speed, not because it's rational.  I don't want to go bloat the think by unrolling loops!

Programmer psychology is easy to give in a nutshell.

Interrupts are something you want to brag about if you know and let other people know you know them.

Assembly language, the same thing.

You never want to make a multitasking error -- that's show you were not smart.

Cooperative multitasking

blocking

Everybody is eager to show they're not dumb.  They are too eager.  You would be very strange if you did not rise to the bait to prove you knew one of these things.

I'm a reverse snob and love being obnoxiously simple.  Trivial Solutions.  Any genius can make it complicated.
