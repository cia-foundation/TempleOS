It seemed like a ritual sacrifice.  I watched up until Tina Fey said she didn't have sex until her husband and was fat.  Now, that I think about it... Tina Fey made fun of Sarah Palin.

I got brutalized by some demon -- CIA tortured Aaron Swartz until death.  Guess what?  I'm here to torture CIA.  Say hello to Mr. God, you shitz!

Justice is right.  Justice is done.

I had praise for street smarts.  Howard Stern is a fucken demon -- too street smart.  He seems like a pathetic pervert who needs full nude because more innocent do much for him.

A fat table is a simple concept.  Implementing a file allocation table file system is not a big deal, inventing it is what is patented.  I'll bet many cannot even think of any alternatives.

I worked at a company, Graphic Technologies.  I programmed chips to put on printer cartridges so they could be refilled.  (The printer company wanted to sell more cartridges, so they put chips that expired and prevented refilling.)  To make the chips work, the chips needed to say, "Copyright Xerox", in ASCII in the chips.

Xerox thought the legal system was fools.  They thought saying "Copyright Xerox" was a clever way of making so no one could refill their cartridges.  It went to the Supreme Court with Lexmark vs Static Control.  In that case, Lexmark sold cheap cartridges if you promised not to refill them.  Lexmark lost in the Supreme Court.

the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the
people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:
but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin
not.

20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
thick darkness where God was.

20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from
heaven.

20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make
unto you gods of gold.$FG$
