into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging;
that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.

22:25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman,
and uncondemned?  22:26 When the centurion heard that, he went and
told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this
man is a Roman.

22:27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
thou a Roman? He said, Yea.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but
the LORD looketh on the heart.

16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And
he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
LORD chosen this.

16:10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

16:11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the
sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not
sit down till he come hither.

I look back on my previous jobs.  I don't know CIA or angels or what, but everything looks like angels were patronizingly making work for me and my whole reality -- all the media was as unreal as the Truman show.

Get a job?  Wha?

I make a quizical face and shake my head in disbelief to the notion of making money.  All of this shit is ridiculous, more or less for Truman in the Truman show.

More or less I'm Truman from the Truman show.  I feel no guilt.  I feel no control over my life.  I'm an FBI/CIA prisoner, more or less or some shit, maybe angels.

I thought of the Truman show before the Truman show and inspired it in an ironic funny self-fulfilling way.

I'm not saying that is my reality.  Philosophically, God make reality unknowable and you just stumble along slightly gripping different realities at the moment and not for a minute actually thinking you know reality.

laid, in the month Zif: 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month
