If you are overbearing on someone, perhaps, you break their spirit and they become husks, like sapped of life by a vampire.  I commented on the Pope doing things cliched.

When Obama took-over in the financial crisis, it didn't seem like he did anything but painfully unoriginal and obvious, with the exception of saving a car company.  "I could have done that!" is what I thought.

When I was 12, I babysat Kevin's kids.  I thought being a professional babysitter means you have to change them.  I changed Kim.  It was nothing -- just being a professional.

In 1990, I bought a camera for a trip to the northwest.  I took photos of Kevin's kids.  Ryan has his shirt off and Kim looks... slutty?  Dad really liked the pictures.  I tried to throw them away because I'm superstitious on anything from my past.  In 1996 I gave away everything, like Jesus said to be perfect.  Dad started grabbing shit to save.  I want to be perfect like Jesus said.  Dad is a pedophile and he figured he could use the Kim photos against me.  They're nothing.

My compiler is almost as optimized as gcc, but is only 20,000 lines of code.  It can run in JIT or AOT mode.

I am the best programmer on the planet with divine intellect.

My operating system is 100% open source.

There are just to AOT binary files.

/Kernel.BIN.C
/Compiler/Compiler.BIN.Z

Those account for 50,000 lines of code.

The other 50,000 lines of code are compiled JIT every time you boot.
