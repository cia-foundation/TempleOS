When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

2) Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

3) Windows must burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

TempleOS is God's official temple.  God said to use 640x480 16 color graphics and God said to have a single audio voice.  That is just like how He specified cubits in the Bible!  He also said it must be perfect.  God needs a temple as a special beloved place where His people, young and old, can do offerings and consult God in the oracle.  Like Solomon's Temple, this is a focal point for the community.  Adults can write hymns, psalms (poems of praise) and meditation essays with good support for links to the Bible.  Like Cain and Abel, do offerings and learn what God likes and doesn't like.

* TempleOS will be limited to 100,000 lines of code, not including applications and demos.  This will ensure it stays out of trouble going a thousand years into the future.  It will not stray much from my vision as long as this is kept.  Other, less important, characteristics can be changed but as long as the 100,000 line limit is kept, it will stay true. 
 
* It must be kept perfect.  $FG,4$$BK,1$Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed.$FG$$BK,0$  You are safest working with $FG,2$JIT$FG$ compilation instead of $FG,2$AOT$FG$ binaries because members to classes can be added and reorder, args with defaults can be added to existing functions, changes to $FG,2$#define$FG$ values can be made, all without breaking compatibility.

* TempleOS is $FG,2$ring-0-only$FG$, running everything in kernel mode including applications.  You have full access to memory, I/O ports, instructions, etc. at all times, because that's fun.  It is simpler and faster, too.

* TempleOS will always $FG,2$identity-map$FG$ memory in a $FG,2$single-address-map$FG$ configuration.  (Virtual addresses are always kept equal to physical addresses with a single map for all tasks on all cores.)  It's as though paging is not used.

* TempleOS will always be for one platform -- $FG,4$$TX,"x86_64",HTML="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"$$FG$ PC compatibles.

* TempleOS will never have networking, so malware is less of an issue.

* TempleOS will always have one video mode, $FG,2$640x480$FG$ by 16 colors, unless that mode becomes unavailable on computers in the future.

* TempleOS will always just have PC Speaker sound.

* TempleOS will always be $FG,2$free$FG$.  I might sell applications, support, or, possibly, do adware.

* TempleOS will always be $FG,2$100% open source$FG$ with all source included, unless device drivers or something can only be included with non-disclosure agreements.

* All function args and returns will be 64-bit.  No plans for C++.

* TempleOS documents are not for printing.  They're dynamic and intended for the screen.  There will always be just one font, a fixed-width font.  No Unicode, just "8-bit ASCII".

* TempleOS is not for multimedia.  Games will be created by programmers, not artists.  Sounds and images will be, primarily, calculated in real-time, not fetched.

* All functions, variables and class members will be accessible.  There are no C++ $FG,2$public$FG$/$FG,2$private$FG$ protections and all functions, even secondary ones in the kernel, can be called.

I like multicore, but single core speed is better, obviously.  Ironically, I'm the only operating system that can use multicore in games.  Games are real-time.  SMP means the scheduler moves the tasks to a free CPU.  In a game, you want to assign one task to each core and you certainly don't want the scheduler messing with it.  You need to know how many cores, so you can update one strip of the screen.

I use 6 cores instead of 8 because I am in VMware.  When running my flight simulator, if VMware borrows a core for Windows stuff, suddenly... I assigned 1/8th of the screen to each core and a single core gets borrowed...  That's no good!  The screen update is put on hold because 1/8th of the screen has not been drawn!  Instead of 30 fps, I get 15 fps or worse and horrible glitches.

In SMP, they figure 7 cores one cycle and 1 core the next cycle is just the same as 8 cores.  When I am missing 1/8th of the screen being drawn and all put on hold, that is not acceptible.


Multicore is fun, when you have low level control -- let the kids play with it.  It's fairly difficult to get a net gain.  I don't use a GPU, so I can put multicores to use on updating the screen, fairly easily.

I actually like not using GPU just for the transparency.  It makes multicore neat, too.

I analysed a little more.  Grotesquely out of joint limbs causes a perfectly natural revulsion and horror.  My Mom has lame legs.  I decided they didn't go looking for crippled elephants -- it's common, so I got less angry.

I have a birthmark.  It causes revulsion and horror.  Brown spot on my knee.

14:8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: 14:9 The
same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving
that he had faith to be healed, 14:10 Said with a loud voice, Stand
upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.

14:11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their
voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us
in the likeness of men.

14:12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because
he was the chief speaker.

14:13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought
oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with
the people.

To Pope hugged an elephant man diseased person.  It disgusted me as too cliched.  Now, he's sneeking-out helping homeless?  Oh, come-on!  Are their people who haven't read Prince and the Popper in one of its hundred incarnations?  I recently deleted a perfectly good song because it seemed a little too familiar.

Maybe, the Pope is playing to a crowd so young they don't know the cliched stories.

19:1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace
to Jerusalem.

19:2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love
them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the
LORD.

19:3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine
heart to seek God.

Guess what I did in 1996 when I was an atheist and discovered God?  I quit my job and gave all my money and belongings away... and moved into a homeless camp... and helped-out at a homeless kitchen a few days...

I would be disgusted, now, with how stupid this was.  I guess it all worked-out.

Be careful of, "If bad is good, worse must be better."

If helping the poor is good, the best is helping the poorest.  It is not as noble to help an American who lost his job and needs thousands of dollars when there are poor people in Africa who need a dollar a day.  Somebody else cure cancer.

Giving to charity is insanity if you think you can do it intelligently, LOL.
