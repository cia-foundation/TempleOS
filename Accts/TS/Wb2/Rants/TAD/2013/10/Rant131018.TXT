I can and have proven God exists.

Technically, I have just proven a powerful lifeform.  I'm not stupid -- I'm calling Him God.  I have evidence He has acted with foreplanning since Bible days.  It could generations.

You've proven God does not exist; now, prove He does.

I was thinking about the milk digestion gene in humans.  One individual had a mutation and all of us are his discendents, more or less?  So, it's like everybody else got killed-off, if you think about it.

How many milk digestion genes are there in human evolution?  For any progress in evolution, that's just crazy!

I believe in evolution.  I have proven God exists and can control things.  It points to Him being active during evolution.  That points to more rapid progress than just random.  We really have no quantative probability understanding of evolution.  It could be anything -- orders of magnitude higher probability than just non-intelligent-design, whatever that means.

Everybody knows 16-bit asm because we all lived in 1990.  Only I know 64-bit asm because I wrote an assembler and compiler.

Mine has been 64-bit since late 2007.  I planned ahead from 2004 for 64-bit making emulated EAX:EDX EBX:ECX operations.

In 2004, with-in a month or two of starting, I had written a C interpretor for the command-line.  I made it a full optimized compiler over the years.  I have worked 10 years, full-time, and written 130,000 lines of code.

I have no code from other sources.  All was written from scratch -- no cruft.  God's temple must be perfect without blemish.

God said 640x480 16 color.  He likes that.  It is more or less the same logic as giving children 8-color crayon boxes.

It has many advantages.  My built-in LZW compression works on 16 color, for example.

I did an electronic device for regulating wall socket voltage (line regulator).  My boss handed me an competator.  It had relays.  I made relays.  Boss said to do solid state.  God said reverse engineering is okay for young engineers.  Omron makes relays.

So, I had to change taps to pick the right voltage and TRIAC are a bitch because they false trigger and two taps short-circuit.  It burned traces.  Solid State relays cost $$20 and I needed 6, but TRIAC were like $$5 for each circuit.  The competitor product was like $$150 total and used 3 relays.

I got this things that's fucken short-circuiting, is way higher priced than the competator... I'm feeling miserable.  It is solid-state -- better product.  But I ended-up putting little resisters in each of the 6 tap circuits to act as fuses.  They burn if short-circuit and act as current limiters.  Fucken waste power in regular operation.  What a nightmare.  I'm at Ticketmaster.  What the hell am I doing making line regulators against a company that does that for a living?  One engineer!

In a bar code reader or something, memory protection at best might automatically restart you product if it crashes.  Do you fucken even know what memory protection is?  You God damn niggers!  Fuck You and your fucken brainwashing bullshit nonstop years and years of this fucken bullshit. Enough! Shut up!

Why do you care if I don't use memory protection.  Mine is faster than everybody else's.  That's why you care.  You are like a paranoid evil fucker with a secret that will cause rebellion against the powers that be.  You keep telling me "Shut Up!" when I make a system without memory protection.  What's it to you?  You are very very worried about what I do.  You don't want people seeing how much better it is and abandoning your piece of shit!  Brainwashing!

God says...
