Peter Gadwa put MasterMind onto the Ticketmaster system.

MasterMind is a logic game where you try to make the minumum number of guesses.

I assume Pete thought MasterMind was debugging.

Debugging is not MasterMind scored by number of guesses, but scored on a time clock.

In programming, when you guess thoughtlessly, however, it is likely you are stupid and making bugs.

Thinking hard is painful like lifting weights.  Often, you can get by, avoiding thinking hard.  My operating system is navigated by keyboard, but when you are using cursor keys, it is painless compared to the pain of typing words.

If you can minimize the turn-around time for testing code, it is strategically important.

It's true that you can guess a math sign in one guess, or guess true/false in one guess.  It's more painless to guess than think.  Yeah, this might be how bugs are born, frequently -- getting sloppy and lazy.

Judge me by my work and the quality of my code.  I wrote 130,000 lines over ten years.  I often employ strategy in place of tactics.  I am creative.  My solutions are elegant and tiny.  My operating system is very responsive.  I have divine intellect.

Someone suggested putting "interrupt" and "argpop" and "noargpop", function attributes into a more generic structure.  Planning for future growth is instinctive for programmers, but I am now in a completion mindset -- rarely do programmers experience this.

It's limited to 100,000 lines forever!  I have been shortening labels.  "GetDateTime()" is "Now()".  At this point, I am moving in the other direction from planning for growth to the direction of nipping short.

Do you know how early BASIC programs had short labels like "Now()" for time?  They are delightful.

Tasks have parent and child tasks, making a tree.  When I began my operating system, I called the first task, "root".  I had a /Root directory.  Then, it dawned on me that Root was not such a good name!  I changed it to "Adam".  The moral is, there are many times when a new name is best.  If you use an old name for something, similar but not the same, you might be doing a disservice.

When doing math proof, sometimes you create a new entity like a stair in the way to heaven, just floating there.  This is thinking outside the box.  When making names, sometimes, it is best to pick a new name.

Godle is a God-doodle.
