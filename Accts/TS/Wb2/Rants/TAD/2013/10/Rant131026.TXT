Mine is viable, but limited to being an auxiliary operating system.

I discovered one of four native machines did not have mouse interrupt firing.  I made mine able to poll and not use mouse.  Don't worry, once every millisecond it takes about 2 microseconds to check.  It's wasting about 1 thousandth of the CPU power to poll the mouse.

The cocky little fucks mock not using interrupts.  It's compatibility, stupid.  That's why I win and you lose.  Mine is viable.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to just blocks on RedSea.)

I don't know how to break this to you, but I was doing interrupts for the Commodore 64 in 1984.  It big magic for you, but you are a nigger.

Newbies play with binary flags 1<<8.  Veterans use hex 0x100.  Always use hex for everything, LOL.

I see beauty in not using ENUMS.  I just use #define.  To me that is beautiful.  That makes my day.  It is completely delightful.  I don't use typedef either.  I use class.


AN inexperienced programmer of a conservative bend prolly uses UNION a lot.  Not wise.

When you know what is efficient, it takes experience to know when to be effecient and when to be clear.

I am a 25 year operating system developer veteran.  I have done ten years of asm programming on x86, 8051, VAX, 68000, PIC, AVR.  I own this world of system development.

There are smart people of my caliber but in my littel CIA cell, I'm stuck with niggers.  I'm stuck with niggers.

My #assert is compile time.  The run-time assert is very gay I can't even fathomn the gayness of a special "Assert" run-time shitty thing -- write good code, faggot.  LOL

I do signatures to validate many of my data structures. That's because they are exposed to users handing them garbage.  There's something wrong with paranoid shit like that, normally.  That's like when you made a bug and can't find it and throw useless garbage just hoping.  When you debug, remove all crap you put in there because you were chasing a bug.  It's like a surgeon leaving a sponge when doing surgery.  If that shit wasn't a good idea in the first place, take it back out.  You don't want legions of clueless programmers dumping useless debug paranoid shit in there because they don't know what's going on.

I have a couple internal-error generating checks in my compiler.  If you add codes to my compiler, you might need them.  It's normal to add codes.  Maybe, it's done.

It's not a firm rule not to have paranoid run-time asserts, but you have to admit, if you made a bug you can't find, you shouldn't have.  I use "stare-dwon" debugging.  I look at the code.  Once in a while I guess I can't see straight.  It's fortunate I don't need to single step, like a kid who doesn't know what the ASM instructions do.  I know what they do.  It is not a mystery.  I don't need to single step, which is fortunate, cause it's not pleasant with my debugger.  It's possible.

At Ticketmaster all of our hardware devices had our bare-metal code.  When you move onto a new device, you write a serial-port based debugger.  I have been a professional operating system developer for 25 years.  It is routine.  The first thing you write for a new platform is a debugger.  Everybody knows that.  An operating system includes tools.  You'll want your debugger to recognize PSECT for symbolic debugging.

If you have tools from a 3rd party, have fun.  I guess a pro would use them.  I started my operating system on bare metal in 1993, actually.  Fucken panzies run in BOCHs.  I'm sure that is a curse which just misleads you.  Now, you have two problems -- emulator bugs and real-hardware bugs.  I don't want the confusion of an emulator.  I like being able to look in the INtel datasheets and know exactly what's going on.  I don't want to second guess, "Maybe it's bochs".  Second guessing is a nightmare.  debugger bugs are really bad, by the way.  LOL.  You want to turn-off all interrupts in a debugger, obviously.  I poll keyboard when in debugger.  Think about it.

I don't really want to do any programming.  If I get started on something fun, it's fun.  In a sane world, the next thing would be a hellish nightmare for me -- feedback on bugs.  "It doesn't boot!"  In VMware it's guarenteed to boot.  I want people to have the option of native install.  I'm not going to force the issue.

You know the ObamaCare problem?  On Leno, Obama said, "I'm guessing bubble sort is not right."  Tell him to say, "Just do another abstraction layer."

The is something evil about keeping people ignorant... of computers.  Many programmers try to do obsfucation.  The CIA teaches bad on purpose.  

We hold these truths to be self evident... that self evident understanding is more self evident and better.  It is better to run TempleOS natively... if you are a nerd male between 13 and 80.  You can take great satisfaction in know wht the fuck is happening.  Abstraction layers like VMware deprive man of self-evident understanding.

Life is a journey, not just a destination.  If you find yourself enraptured in a compelling thing, that's Heaven.  If God tells you a riddle, that's Heaven.  what were you expecting?  Just think -- for an hour today, you were fully engaged in a neato thought.  That's as good as it gets.  Think about it.  Look at your life and make a note of the times when you are happy.  I think they balance.  The low times are better than nothing, except some times.  Look at life as a series of highs and lows.  Every now and then take note that you are in an up mood and think about it being as good as it gets and be satisfied.  God's company is Heaven.  He carries-on nice conversation.

Don't worry you're going to miss-out.  Highs and lows balance.
