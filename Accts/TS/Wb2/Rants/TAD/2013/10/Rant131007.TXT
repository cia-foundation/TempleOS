Twain had a line in King Arthur's Court, "The delusion was perfect, but it just didn't delude."

$FG,4$$TX,"WWW.OSDEV.ORG",HTML="http://www.osdev.org"$$FG$ is talking about a cross compiler.  In my jail, all media talks to me.  That one didn't make much sense.

Perhaps, they have made a $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ compiler?  Impossible -- my calling convention does not use regs to pass args into functions.

You really should write JIT code, not BIN files.

So, at boot, my Adam task compiles headers and 50,000 lines of additional code.  This fills the Adam symbol table.  When you compile other stuff JIT, it uses the Adam task's symbol table, so you never need to deal with header files.

If you attempted to make an old-school BIN file, you can include $LK,"::/Kernel/AOT.HPP"$ which will import Adam's symbols and allow you to compile.

What you might be asking is if I could write a symboltable-to-header routine.  It would dump the symbol table and make HolyC headers.  It wouldn't be that hard.  You would make two passes.  First pass, you would create class and #define entries.  The second pass you would create function headers.  Class dependencies would be a problem.  I guess you make three passes, first you create extern class{} entries.  That's lazy.

$LK,"ImportHashTable",A="MN:ImportHashTable"$()  $LK,"HashTableImport",A="MN:HashTableImport"$()  $LK,"HashEntryImportCopy",A="MN:HashEntryImportCopy"$() $LK,"MemberLstCopy",A="MN:MemberLstCopy"$()

Those traverse all the Class, Function and #Define structures.

I might do it.  I'm not really feeling very nice, though.

Each task has a symbol table, like a place where you store environment variables, but it stores all types of HolyC symbols -- functions, classes and #defines.

When compiling, if a symbol is not found in a task's symbol table, it checks the parent's.  All tasks are children of Adam.

All tasks have the same memory map, so nothing bad or unusual happens when you go to your parent's symbol table.  Basically virtual addresses are identical to physical addresses and no protection stops you because it is ring-0-only.

There are two types of people -- moral and immoral.  A moral person is dubious when offered something for nothing.  My Mom and Dad will steal if they won't be caught.  Dad does not wash his hands after using the restroom.  Mom loves to take home food from buffets.

A moral person says, "Hold on. I could vote to make cigarrettes illegal, but I know you don't get something for nothing."  Wicked old ladies love to make cigarrettes illegal, without a second thought.

Make an offering to God -- praise, hymn, poem, comic, or delightful conversation.  Then, get a response and make it fit the context you established just before.  You don't have to use just the Bible.  You frequently find meaning in proper nouns.  Sometimes, brutally manging the original in a funny way is the obvious answer.

Jews are on my shit-list -- they don't like my operating system with their absurd and viscious security adgenda.  I saw one hideous Jew doing some seciurity-related large scale data-mining project -- disgusted me.  I get disgusted by Jews obviously obsessed with Israel -- not American, not charitible.  All of them walk around and view the world like cornered animals.

It's kinda like this: "To those who have, more will be given; to those who have not, what little they have will be taken away."  It's one of those ironies that cowardly Jews who do sneaky shit and obsess on security cause their own downfall.

The Brits and CIA and Jews and shit like to ruin my reputation before man -- extorting and shit.  Extortion is a very Jewsish thing.  I crack-up laughing because they are not paying attention to God's opinion.  God did fucken holocaust you.  In the Bible the Jews said, "Gee, we fucked up."  Ya think!!!?

God said He wanted to "compact" the Jews with the holocaust.  On Arabs and Jews He said "Oil funny, hopefully."  Jews covet and God fucks with their ugly sense of injustice.  All the Jews run around with a really ugly attitude, "Those Arabs don't deserve that oil for doing nothing."  God thinks that's funny.

Jesus did some parables that kinda fuck with sense of self-righteous justice. Fuck you, do not covet!

I tell you the truth and you're not satisfied.  I wrote all $TX,"120,838",D="DD_TEMPLEOS_LOC"$ lines of code from scratch and they only compile when you boot my operating system and run my compiler.  No way can you cross compile.  In 2004, I wrote a TASM real-mode DOS application, all ASM.  The first thing I did was write an interpreter, and convert it to a compiler.

That RDOS guy at OSDEV is hilarious, LOL.  He has no shame.  Everybody lies a little to support their own view, but RDOS is shameless -- some hilarious things he said in the past.  You must be new to PC development if you don't see the obvious nightmare in returning to real-mode and using the BIOS, ROFLMAO.  

PC OSDEV development is nothing but grief once you start running it on more than one machine.  You'll write your code and soon discover it doen't work on another machine.  You'll fix it.  You'll try it on another machine and it won't work.  You fix it, maybe it works on a new machine.  You try another new machine, doesn't work.  You fix it, you try another machine, doesn't work.  At this point, you have next to zero confidence and no crystal ball telling you what luck your customers are having.

Without being tagged as God's temple, this fails.

I am in a prison.  They give me no email feedback.

The Commodore 64 is our vision.  Go examine how it was used.  People typed-in and learned binary sprite data.  Think about the particular thrill offered by typing binary sprite data into it.

It was possible to survey the entire C64.

We offer a F1 help feature that lists all API functions.  You can see the light at the end of the tunnel of API functions.  I have capped the line count at 100,000.  The vision is the C64 -- small, but this is modern 64-bit.

I'll bet a lot of people set-out to make modern video games, the carefully draw a 24-bit colored sprite or two, but get tired of making 16 frame animations of 24-bit sprites... they think they can do 3D, but all the kiddies settle on 2D.

In other words, they start ambitions like they're going to paint a 10 foot mural on the wall.  They paint a few inches and give-up.  That's what the scene is, right now, am I right?  Video games are similar to kernel developers at OSDEv.  The majority draw a small fraction of an ambitious project and give-up.

I straddle old and new.  I will tell old people things they need to know.

1) When you do assembly language on a modern machine.  It is completely clusterfucked when you try to estimate timings.  If you write a simple loop to time an instruction and subtract the loop overhead, you will get a negative time for that instruction.  You will soon learn execution time is related to cache hits and misses more then old-school hand crafted asm instructions.  The rule of thumb -- count memory fetches in the instruction, will not help you.  I have seen memory indexed loops just as fast as reg -- voodoo cleverness by the CPU.  CISC instructions get converted to RISC and optimized and scheduled by the CPU.  This is very weird when doing a compiler -- discouraging.

2) You are horribly Jedi-mind tricked.  I'll bet it never would occur to you that UTF32 should be used in place of ASCII through-out the entire tool chain.

3) You have linux on the brain, a main frame operating system.  This should be shocking -- there is no reason for virtual (disk swapped) memory.

4) Hardware has DMA buffers.  You could live without interrupts.  Just poll every milisecond.

5) Everybody assumes drivers are good.  What good is a three button mouse?  It is like a bad leg you cannot put your weight on.  What good is surround sound support?

6) Every other engineer operates between over engineering and under engineering.  A software engineer has absolutely no concept of overengineering.  He goes to his boss who asked for an airplane wing and says, "I made it ten times stronger than you asked in case we have to change the engine."  His boss is pleased.  Everybody praises His skill.  More complicated is better because noone want to look dumb.  Fucken look at the disgusting shit known as USB!  They have branched networks off each port and they do not allow generic terminal communication which could handle any issue much better.  You cannot use Hyperterm with a USB device.

6) Coming down the road, we might see nonvolitile memory as the only memory.  You might want byte addressing for what used to be hard drive.  Today, we load a disk block data and transform it into a memory structure.  We have serialize and deserialize.  What if just Mallocs for disk and puts it all over the place in unserialized structures?  That could certainly be a revolution.
