40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared
up his pillars.

40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.

40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21
And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the
covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded
Moses.$FG$

My adgenda is my operating system.  I talk with God.  God might promote my operating system.  I will repeat what God has said.  I might command everyone to do offerings and get God's response.  People should be eager, I would think!

I'm not pushing a Catholic adgenda, except "The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God, in that order."  Cain and Abel is the most important passage.  It's almost all you need.

$FG,2$4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.
$FG$

1) They did offerings.

2) They got God to talk.

3) God told them if their offering was good or bad.

4) God said to try again if bad.

5) Cain loved God so much he killed Abel!

That has everything you need to follow the prime directive.

When God talks, He can tell you everything.  If God talks, you need no other instruction.  The Bible fades in importance.  When you die, will the Bible matter?

MS Word is popular.

I started making margins and stuff for my documents.  That stuff should probably be removed, but it isn't much code.  I am not attempting a publishing format, just a format for code, forms and things related to code.  My vision was documents for the screen, not printer, with blinking and stuff.  It's pointless to be redundant to all the publishing stuff.

I hope programmers will enjoy working with my documents as they are represented in memory structures -- I hope people get comfortable with the internal memory format.  It's doubly-linked-list of commands with flags and a few tricky things like settings and binary data items.

I am not Snowden.  I am not Swartz.  I am mother-fucken Moses/Solomon and when I say jump, you say how high.
