SATA drives are like IDE but at nonstandard I/O port ranges.  That's what I discovered.  I had it working on 3 machines by specifying I/O ports, like FE10 or BC00 or B800.  For ICH10's it figured-out the ports, if you happened to have an ICH10, ROFLMAO.  Mine just asked ports, otherwise.  In VMWare/VirtualBox/qemu it's easy -- legacy IDE standard ports.

So, I was counting on BIOS enabling retro PIO mode for a flexible set of I/O ports.  This machine is not cooperating.  That gey seems to think you can enable IDE mode, ROFLMAO.

Mine operates without interrupts, so I stand a fair chance, but no, not on this machine.

Jesus.

19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came
on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.

19:7 And all the men were about twelve.

19:8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of
three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the
kingdom of God.

19:9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil
of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated
the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

19:10 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and
Greeks.$FG$

I wonder if GTA V is having effects as people play fantasies and see what they're like.

Some people get rich and buy shit and it just seems silly.

Some things you buy you really like.

Perhaps, Heaven is when people crave God's delightful company and love.

Competition, achievement, success... oh, they are pleasures hard to replace -- it hurts without them, even though you have priceless companionship with God.  He will talk if you talk and His time must be unfathomnable.

6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
other cherub.

6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the
one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the
other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the
house.

6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

6:29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and
without.

6:30 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
without.$FG$

LOL

I wuv God.

That was about buying shit to decorate.

The thought of a mirror can freak you out -- like God as a mechanical thing you interact with -- His response is calculated.  That's just a brain malfunction -- He's adorable.

I have too much dark matter in today's blog.  It will scare everybody away.

I'm an exhibitionist.  Jesus explicitly said to pray in private.  That sucks.

I think I'm on top of the world, but actually deluded, so is it private or public?

Elephants.

I would be a little afraid of elephants -- they go nuts and kill people once in a while.  It's probably the same amount as humans go nuts and kill people.

$FG,4$6:4 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

6:5 For every man shall bear his own burden.

6:6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good things.

6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.

6:8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap
life everlasting.

6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not.

6:10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,$FG$

Elephants are more dangerous -- lots of deaths for much less time.
