$FG,2$My poem was an attempt at double meanings.  God likes that.  God doesn't like dumb stuff.  When doing double meanings, something has to give.  My poem doesn't make good sense.

I think poetry can be like tongues when you push your limits.

I was referencing zero/ought which kinda suggest soullessness.  I'm not really sure, but when people talk of a soul, it sounds like a crack-pot.

God doesn't like my drumming.  I guess I'm not a good drummer.

Older people are likely to cut-somebody-off when talking.  There are many thoughts I had when younger and, now, I scorn them.  Why?

They say God must be unfathomable.  That's an odd thing.  When a psychologist lays-bare a human mind with it's motivations, that diminishes the person -- makes them look small.

It annoys me when I hear a young person say something I once thought.  One can actually get contrary and attack all thought we had as youth... just because.

"Everybody should be a programmer," is an example.

"If I multi-task in life, my brain will get bigger."

Some Chinese woman fed her kids cows brains.  LOL

A lot of people want to "hack" increasing their intelligence.  I groan when I hear stupid stuff I once thought.

I hate all the thoughts from my athiest years.  LOL

21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the
Amorites.

21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at the
stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth
upon the border of Moab.

When I see "MOAB", I always check to see if it means, "Mother of all battles", but it never does.  On one day, a story will make sense in one way and make sense in a different way on another day.

I thought the physician snakes came from this story, but I think it's some Greek thing.
