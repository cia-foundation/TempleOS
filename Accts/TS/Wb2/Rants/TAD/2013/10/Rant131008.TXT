I did FAT32 filesystem, then got distraught because FAT was patented and the enemies were psy-oping me.  So, I made my own file system and removed FAT.  I made is simple, so could not be sued.  I added FAT back in, a couple years later.

It one point I had encryption -- just made-up nasty formula.  I decided it was too stressful and also did not want the stress of provoking the enemy.  Encryption really is against my way of thinking.

BASIC might be good, but I want no part of it.  I certainly would be opposed to a bastardized BASIC proving full functionality.  It's for beginners.  There are two problems -- you would ruin its simplicity and you would cause people to cling when they should move-on to HolyC.  I would want interpreted BASIC instead of compiled, just so it sucked, and saved line count.  I like the 100,000 line cap.  Actually with a JIT HolyC compiler a BASIC compiler would be just about as easy as interpreted.

I told you I want to make Windows and Linux support my Red Sea filesystem in place of FAT32 AND ISO9660, so I can remove that nasty redundnacy and save line count and make God's perfect.

I have a cluster allocation bitmap.  I kinda kept clusters from FAT32.  You know what?  It should probably be optimized for tiny sized drives.  That's what all my current stuff is.  I could just use blocks, not clusters.  Someone had an idea of teared bitmaps.  Well, I'm wondering if I should have big balls and pick blocks and not teared.

I'm in no hurry.  I'll just change it down the road and not think twice about havoc, LOL.

Switch debouncing alone could alter which USB cycle it reged on.

The fucken calculations -- you have to know 8000 words and plot a trajectory of roughby evenly timed intervals to pick-off 20 words about half a second apart.  You cannot get any word you want, you must choose from about 10 possible words.  You have to know how the Mhz clock syncs with the 1kHz clock -- it doesn't.  You have...

Let's just say this is equal to "You only use 10% of your brain."  Except you declared war on God and He's gonna fuck you bad.


So the stream of 8000 words is modulo postitioned on a 1Mhz clock and that 1Mhz clock signal is passing under a 1Khz clock, not a fixed modulo interval and I press the button about every 500milliseconds +/- 10mS  and I have to predict what interrupt cycle and message passing is in play on for the time of the sampling of the 1Mhz clock.  Yeah -- it's 1Mhz critical not 1kHz critical because the task delays in windowes messaging vary in micreoseoncds.

Every single electrical engineer on the planet will call you the stoopidest nigger shrink quacks ever!!  It's not even close.

Someone at OSDev might be having upgrade difficulties.  I feel evil.  Boot the new ISO, CopyTree("T:/","C:/") the directories onto the hard drive, MakeOSInstallBootLoader('C').

I can't understand what delusion OSDev is trying to say.  I thought it was obvious HolyC could only be compiled by my own compiler, since I invented the language.  My language has different operator precidence rules and has postfix typecasting.  

Perhaps, they made a HolyC modification to gcc.  #exe{} is a feature where code executes at compile time. That presents a nightmare.  The purpose of the code is to ask config questions and insert a few spots of custom code into the stream.

Upgrading is often quite tricky, espcially, if you are doing a merge, I imagine. Boot the new ISO and use the new ISO compiler to compile the new code once you install the new code on the hard disk.

I wrote all the code from scratch, including the compiler and bootloaders.

You know?  Elephants really have signs of fat-folds and stuff.  If elephants were humans, they'd be pretty awful.  They have dignity and exude cheerful goodness.  No evil vibes from an elephant.  Elephants are kinda like fat chicks.  Everybody's got good and bad moods but fat chicks usually are nice.  They can be demon spawn shrews, but psychologists did a study and fat people are jolly.

Someone is missing a header.  You don't need headers in JIT mode.  Applications are writting in JIT mode.

If you are working on the kernel or compiler modules, you static compile the .PRJ file.

This is my old grub file. My boot-loaders will not boot Linux.  Linux needs grub.  I don't think Linux does normal chain loading like Windows or TempleOS.
 

menuentry "TempleOS D" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos1)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "TempleOS E" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "TempleOS I" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd1,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}

Those are probably out of date.  Grub is evil.  I edited the direct file -- you're supposed to fuck around with a file that generates it.

Just use my boot-loader.  $LK,"::/Doc/Boot.TXT"$
The trick to my boot-loader is you must run an Install to patch it.
