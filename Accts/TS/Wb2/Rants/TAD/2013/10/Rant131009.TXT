At the moment, my back's not hurting, my feet don't hurt, no problem with my teeth and my stomach's okay.  I don't have any trouble with the law, my finances are not a problem and no relative has a problem, not that I would know.

Thank You, God!

Both my birds are alive and my parents are alive.  I have not seen death.

Nothing is good, but nothing is bad.

I don't have a car, I don't have a job, I don't have wife or kids.

I don't have bills, I don't have chores or anything I have to do.

I ate a really good frozen microwaved pot pie.  Normally, when eating, you get a bit of gristle or bone or a hair -- usually, there's something that's a downer.  Today, I decided to notice when there's nothing bad.

I send emails to Gordon Ramsay telling him he should be CEO.  Normally, I'd kinda look down on fancy foods, but offering three star experince is to be respected.  It's something to think about in software.  One time, God said bugs were bad because they upset customers.  You might say bugs are sins.  Tears on Christmas sounds bad.  The Bible says not to ruin the mood when someone is cheerful.

God likes soap operas best on TV.  Surely, He likes Ramsay?  I think foods glorify the Creator.

$FG,4$the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; 2:7 That
pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn
aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto
the same maid, to profane my holy name: 2:8 And they lay themselves
down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the
wine of the condemned in the house of their god.

2:9 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the
height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed
his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

2:10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty
years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

2:11 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men
for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the
LORD.

2:12 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the
prophets, saying, Prophesy not.$FG$

The part about turn aside the meek is about Knights who say Ni.  It's about cutting down a tree with a herring.

It could be more serious -- reminds me of Nazis.  Giving the Nazi's wine to drink is like encouraging them.

I'm giggling, though.

One guy is talking about pop-up windows.  God said "No" when I started to make child windows back in 2004.  Instead, it has one window per task.  A pop-up window is a brand new task, that is a child task of the parent.  When you make buttons, they are not windows, just text widgets.
