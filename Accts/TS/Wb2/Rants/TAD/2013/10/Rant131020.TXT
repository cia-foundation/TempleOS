$TX,"This guy who did compiler thing...",HTML="http://nominine.org/2013/10/06/programming_with_equations"$

My compiler works JIT, really easily.  It is recursive -- my compiler calls itself.  It compiles assembler expressions to machine code and when my assembler has an expression with a undefined value, it defines a symbol and codes a indirect reference in the machine code for the expression.  At the end, it processes all the expressions which had undefined values and evaluates them and patches all referrences to them.  The indirections look-up the newly defined value and the expression result is accurate.

If there are an odd number of absolute addresses, it makes a table entry in the BIN header to tell the loader to add an absolute address to the number.  If there are an even number of absolute addresses (label2-label1) it does not tell it to add an absolute.

My compiler generates unoptimized INTERMEDIATE code.  It makes several evaluation passes through the code to simplify constant expressions and optimize.

Did I mention God talks and I'm the best programmer on the planet, chosen to make His temple and He gives me divine intellect?  FUCK YOU!

There are cases where it needs to fetch an absolute address into a variable.
