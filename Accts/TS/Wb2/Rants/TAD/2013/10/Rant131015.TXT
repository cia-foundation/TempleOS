The Bible is almost all conservative, but this is liberal:

Most people think Brave New World is ghastly, but it's actually Christian!  I think all the people who want to be God and kill stupid people should just chill-out and meditate on Brave New World.  There is more to life than IQ.  When humans breed dogs, there's a species of purebreds that is deaf!  Race horses have weak legs.  A liberal thought I actually like is... "Humans are not anygood at breeding -- leave it to God."  It's okay if God does natural selection, but I really don't want humans doing it.  God wants human evolution, you can count on it.  God can even do conception mutations and match-making, causing evolution with no pain!

I sat and pondered evolution of milk consumption in humans.  Do you realize you have to basically kill everybody except one pair just to get something like that universal?  Am I wrong?  Each of these universal traits in humans must happen one at a time almost where that trait is the only one selected where, everybody but one pair dies.  (Not literally, but something like that!  It's a mutation from one person and becomes universal!)

You have proven God does not exist, geniuses, now prove He does.  Go prove evolution could not happen because the probabilities are absurd.  Obviously, it did happen, but God really exists.  Truth is... well...  evolution probably requires God!  Seriously.  As weird as that is... evolution requires God.

If we remove FAT32 and ISO9660, we can add more stuff.  God's temple must be perfect.  In a perfect world you have one file system type and one driver for each kind of device.  You do not have multiple drivers.

Someone did a game or movie on "Pacific Rim"/Frankenstein.  If you don't use God's World, God kinda doesn't like it.  It's weird -- even in the Bible God said to the Jews something bad about the work of their hands.  I can't imagine the Jews doing any creation even remotely questionable, so that's hilarious.  One time, God said I had "chump change lust".  LOL.  Those Jews who had bad works of their hands had chump change bad works of their hand.  LOL
