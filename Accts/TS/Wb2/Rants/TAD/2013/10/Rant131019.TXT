Every 6 months, I give a lump sum, my 10% tithe, to some charity.  I have given to feed-the-world type charities,  KNPR, services for the blind, and Audobon.  Last July I tried to give to KNPR.  I went to their web page; they remembered me and I did a one-time-donation.  It's usually hard to do one-time-donations because they always pressure into memberships.  I hate that.  So, they remembered me and I thought it was odd they didn't ask credit card number, but maybe they remembered.

I check my balance, no transaction.  I wait a couple days, checking... nothing.  I get a call because it's kinda large amount, $$800.  They ask, "Are you sure?"  Yep.  I Wait a couple days.  Nothing.  I say fuck-it and give the money to Audobon.  You have to understand, by this time, this is a very unpleasant customer experience.

I get a statement from KNPR in the mail saying $$800.  Oh shit!  They've overdrafted me!  I sweat for a few days, but no charge shows-up on my account.  I figure-out they want me to write a check.  Fuck-them.

This station has gotten sleazy.  I kinda don't like them.  I just got another "pay us $$800" bill today.  Fuck-em.  I'll think about it in December, but fucking demons make this shit an ordeal when it should be thoughtless ease.  I like paying on-line, not this snail-mail check shit.  Why do you think I pledged on-line?  Son of a bitch.

I have a little brother who takes tipping in a restaurant very seriously.  (I don't like that he essentially makes the waitresses grovel, in a way.) Making KNPR grovel is not what I like to see in the mirror.  Fuck them -- unintentionally, this turned into a demon Hell experience.  Fuck them.

God says...
$FG,4$17:16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

17:17 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?
bring him hither to me.

17:18 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the
child was cured from that very hour.

17:19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not
we cast him out?  17:20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your
unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder
place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

17:21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

17:22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: 17:23 And they shall
kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.$FG$
