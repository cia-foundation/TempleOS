I wonder what I would have though of games if I had been an adult at the time.  Looks a little different as an adult.  Those Atari games probably wouldn't seem quite so cool as adults.  Made total sense as a kid.

Being forced to live in that world would suck.  When you get started on a game, you get sucked-in, maybe.  I have a huge uninterest barrier to overcome.

You kinda like innocent stuff, God?  Naw.  You said sports were homo.  Can't extrapolate, I guess.

You like soap operas.  

It's terrible voyarism if NSA watches girls play The Sims.  That's a game that would be embarassing to play while unknowingly watched.

You're God.  You have seen a whole lotta stuff.

restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I
caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field
fainted for him.

31:16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the

God said the best toy for kids was magnifying glasses.

It's really obvious to praise God for animals.  I watched Gordon Ramsay and discovered food was diverse and entertaining and a topic to praise God for.
