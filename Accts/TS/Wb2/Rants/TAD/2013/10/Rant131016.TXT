$FG,4$17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
him.

17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other
some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he
preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.

17:19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  17:20 For
thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know
therefore what these things mean.

The horse is the man.  The carriage is the woman.  Men do the action of courtship, but women actually make the decision.  It's as though the woman is chasing the man, but the man is doing the work.  The man might think he is chasing -- it sure seems like it.  And it's at a fixed distance.

The radio talks to me.  Reality is unusual.  At Graphic Technologies, it was the Truman Show.  I was red team for the CIA.  I had to counter anti-refill chips for printer cartridges and the CIA observed and made it harder, but not too hard.  There is some cosmic reason not to make it too hard.  When they do encryption, I think they make it so supercomputers can do it, but not too hard.  So, Ken was a coworker whom I didn't like.  He broke my high speed parallel port card and I couldn't get another.  The CIA banned such cards.  They do not want high speed digital I/O for PCs.

Everything is controlled by the CIA.  My graphic in my operating system are awful.  It's probably the CIA.  I heard a roomer of 57 Ghz chips.

I'm not exactly Catholic and pedophile is obviously bad.  I think it was an attack on God with an excuse of pedophile, though.  I'm really not Catholic.

The obviously know it's God -- watching for ten years?  No.  It's a brain dead psychiatric nurse who dismisses it as psychobabble.  We never get anywhere -- they don't even try to read God.

A good reality check is to imagine my Dad as a nurse.  It's just not happening.

One day I got frustrated because I had not carefully chosen U64 vs I64.  Instead of carefully going through all my code, I changed all of them to I64.  I tested my code and whatever was broken, I changed back to U64.

Consistency is next to Godliness.

You, now, know the true reason, but here's my excuse -- in BASIC and similar beginner languages, you have just one integer.  People should always pick I64, unless physically breaks.  There are a few really obnoxious results to this policy.

I don't see how you can simplify MAlloc() and Free() to be any simpler.  I am not a fan of whatever magic they do to hide MAlloc().  A liberal wants to protect the poor kids from the brutal world of ones and zeros of MAlloc() and pointers.  Guess what?  Now, you have two problems and a clusterfucked thing you will eventually have to explain.

Lots of evil comes from liberals wanting to protect young minds from... the real way things work.  They are "proud of heart".

I don't really advocate this, but you could teach 6502 assembly language as an introduction to computers in 8th grade.  It's not complicated -- it's simple.  It's so simple it's complicated.

It seems like people got the scent of "protect young minds from the real way it's done."  Now, there is a stampede of people jumping on the band wagon of ever-more protecting the young people from the way it's really done.

I have a feeling it's FUBAR.  Fucked-up beyond all recognition.  Good intentions -- treating all kids as black and unable to learn.  The liberals.

Sometimes, I actually think Bill Gates is an evil fucker, quite honestly.  "Oh you don't need to learn that, as he fills minds with poisoned warped shit that will cripple them."

You know?  A spread-sheet is an unnatural construct.

Functional programming is unnatural.

SQL is pretty unnatural.  (It's necessary, though.)

The best word for these is "convoluted" and contrary to normal sequenced thought.

I did a report generator for Ticketmaster.  You had to do convoluted constructs.

The poor business people who are not programmers have to learn spread sheets or whatever -- some nasty unnatural language.

I feel sorry for them, but I guess we can't teach them natural programming earlier.

Zuckerberg want everyone to learn to program.  Yeah, I was young and thought that.  Now, I don't think that, I guess.

Most integers, it's obvious if it's signed or unsigned.  Many, however, could go either way.  A prissy faggot will agonize over it.  I saved him the trouble -- use I64 unless it breaks.

Sometimes, a king solves everything.

Tabs are 8 characters.

I did a regulator for wall voltage.  I was going to put a potentiometer in it to calibrate it.  My boss said not to.  I had to work really hard to eliminate an indecision.

When I first did my operating system installation, I prompted for I/O port for ATA/ATAPI.  Then, I tried to get rid of asking the user a question.  It is a monumental amount of work and I didn't quite get it done.... just so the user doesn't have to be bothered.

I think Apple understands simplicity.  I have deep respect.  Little things can take a lot of work to simplify.  I don't always choose simplicity.

My operating system is not minimal.  I have crazy indulgences.  I have a differential equation engine... kinda crazy.  I picked HolyC instead of BASIC.  Fuck BASIC.  I might allow BASIC if Gates wants to do it himself, it'd be kinda cool to give him the honor.


I don't have minimal as a guiding law.  It's whatever makes me happy.  I do want the whole thing small, though.  I don't want it growing.

Words cannot express how evil this song is.

A young mind can latch-onto a moral compass like "Simple Man" and run with it.  That's an evil moral compass -- begging for a lobotomy.  I suggest "Bring glory to God" as your moral compass.  The Bible even says Satan is glorious.

I chose one highlighting color scheme.  You don't need to customize colors -- quit-it.

When I'm in a nasty mood, I say you should be a nomad.  That means you can pick-up and move from machine to machine.  If you don't customize shit, it's easier, but that might be too warlike and Spartan.

The philosophy is, however, that everyone get used to one-key back-ups.  Instead of not ever getting corrupted, we make reinstall easy.  It's really neat having total piece of mind and confidence with full-back-ups in 30 seconds.   Or whatever.  I'm speaking of VMware, mostly, but I really want to move toward Native installs.   It's just... better.  Come-on!

I thought Gates would be tickled to do BASIC, if He understood it to be God's Temple in the same way Solomon's Temple was God's Temple.  I don't care.  I don't even care if we have BASIC or not.  I don't know.

In theory, BASIC is for beginners.  Most people might just say to jump into HolyC.  It's hard to remember what it's like being a beginner.

Those of us old people who grew-up with technology learned in a unique way and the path to our understanding might have been eliminated.

Some people don't want to ruin young minds with GOTO.  An entire generation used GOTO and it didn't do any harm.  There can sometimes be outrage at silly stuff.  Just remember how much stuff we all learned and set aside... that didn't do us any harm.  We learned a whole lots of stuff that would seem a distraction.

I give to charity -- 10% tithe.  There's no rational way to choose.  LOL  You can give to United States poor or to World poor.  I give to Audobon, LOL.

It strikes me that we should love our friends more than our enemies.  It seems a perversion, like homosexuality, to love enemies MORE than friends.

You might give to the poorest... but it can't be good not to help Americans by some logic.

I certainly don't no, but I thought I would share my notion that we should love friends more than enemies.

I'm very proud that I understand "proud of heart" really well.  Don't be proud of heart.  Jesus was humble of heart and got killed 'cause he accepted $$30,000 in perfume.  300 days wages.

A guy suggested asking God what to do in Washington.  I think what has to be accepted is lots of times there are no good answers or it would be easy to decide.

Here's what ya do!  God does equal exchange of offering and response.  If you senators really want God's help, praise Him or do a hymn or something.  You'll get equal value.  Depressing, LOL.  That's probably worthless, isn't it, if the solution is valued in billions.  Who knows how this works, though.

This is not my habit, but many people in the Bible made vows to trade God for stuff.  You really have to bargain with God.

In Nineva when Jonah spoke, all the people put-on sackcloth and ashes and fasted.
