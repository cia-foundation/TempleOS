One lesson is, "don't be proud of heart."  You can break your arm patting yourself on the back for what a good liberal you are.  Just pray it is not your decisions that are acted on.  The military is one place where we don't follow liberal lies.

Home ownership is bad for people relocating to find work.

Life is a journey, not a destination.  A pro athlete or musician is filled with expectant joy.  They get the same joy as people playing the lottery -- hope for a wonderful future.

Buying beer for minors puts you at risk, for nothing.  It is self-less, heroic.  I would not feel good about it... well obviously with my hyper-reality.  Your moral compass can read up when it's down, though.

My favorite moral compass is "Does this glorify God?"

Pigeons.  Someone wants to dwell on vermon.

I put words in my bird's mouth -- "No, no, no, I am not a vermon."

I asked Mom, "If I won the lottery three times in a row, would you believe it's God?"  "No"

Normally, you think stupid people are gullible.

A scientist believes at 4 sigma, I think.

Mom said she had to take the black crayons away from the preschool she taught.  The 4 years olds loved drawing, then, putting black on top, all over.

Those are as good as my songs.  I have to force myself to listen out of politeness.  I guess I see that other people are not especially interested in my hymns!  What I looked for in these was ones I was familiar with.  Ouch.

Oh well.  Jesus said to pray in secret.  It matters not what other think.  Yeah right.

I guess I'm supposed to reflect on 8-bittedness.

8-bit is easy to make.  I don't like singing.

I think the take-away is my hymns are really cheap -- pennies.
