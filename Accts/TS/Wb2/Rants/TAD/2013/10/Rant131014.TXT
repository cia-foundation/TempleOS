If God is manifest and He claims this operating system, here's what I'm going to demand:

1) VMware again supports PC Speaker and provides emulation if no PC Speaker.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to just blocks on RedSea.)

3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.

4) No secure boot.

5) ATA/ATAPI PIO must work

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to real hardware.

8) Can VMware do faster than correct IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI? PIO?

delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the

for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria
oppressed them.

under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in
their tents, as beforetime.

13:6 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained
the grove also in Samaria.)  13:7 Neither did he leave of the people
to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand
footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them
like the dust by threshing.

Carter brought us Little House on the Prairre and Waltons.  Bush brought us super heros and Sponge Bob.  Obama brings us breaking bad -- white criminals.  I've never seen it.

Who would You bring us, God?  Bible stories?  Lots of Bible stories?  Tell us a story, please!
