If VMware says I have 8 cores, each refresh, I divide the screen in 8 strips and tell each core to go to work and I wait for all to finish.  If VMware says I have 8 cores, but gives me seven, I drop a frame.

If you have an 8 core machine, you might want to set VMware to 6 cores, so that it actually gives you 6 cores.
