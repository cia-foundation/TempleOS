You know what?  God did not like my Niagra art.  He uses honest measures.  He does not like my drumming, either.  I don't think God likes sports.  I saw thins insane chase.  A male monkey had a hareem and a group of other males monkeys attacked.   He ran and climbed a tree.  It made human sports look silly.  I wonder if God evaluates all the lion chases on equal terms with human sports activities.  No wonder He doesn't like sports.

I tease God.  We don't have animals the eat prey alive.  God is nice to every creature.  I tease Him that God got His cheap thrills during dinosaur fights.

My original design was for desktops.  If you do not put multicores into a HLT state, you can dispatch faster because it does not take a WAKE interrupt.  The only way to wake a halted CPU is an interrupt.  That is slower than signaling "go" with a memory flag.

I grudgingly got less aggressive in seeking performance and, now, it puts them in a HLT state.  There are times when my CPU is not HLTed but is idle.  I don't remember which. 

SetFakeIdleFlag;
