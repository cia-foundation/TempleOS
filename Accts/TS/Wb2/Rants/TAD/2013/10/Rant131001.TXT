I used to suffer from nightmares.  Yeah, sometimes the news (which intentionally hypes headlines to make them scary) would give me nightmares.  Often, I would dwell on dark topic, like the Holocaust and evolution.

Peter Gadwa said that often an outsider can look at a person and say, "Your problem is obvious!"

Anyway, occassionally, you'll see a person who obesses on dark topics.  It's very profound that you can choose to dwell on happy stuff.  Stay "in the light", unless you like nightmares. LOL

You got nigger-rigging on one end of the engineering spectrum and fine NAZI engineering on the other.

People get a whiff of what it means to be professional, but they are too stupid to actually know.

Interrupts are fine NAZI engineering and no pretender would dream of not doing interrupts.  I poll when I cannot guarentee compatibility -- Interrupts break compatibility.

The pretenders in computer science are not like other engineers.  They have no concept of overengineering.  In computer science, if you make something confusingly complex, the pretenders will think you are the finest NAZI engineer and kiss you ass.  The more clusterfucked and complex, the more the stupid sheep will admire you.

Software engineers have no concept of overengineering -- there is absolutely nothing that keeps them from making it as complicated as possible.  The incentive is such that people will think they are smart if they can't underdstand it.

I am an electrical engineer, not a fucken P=NP cock sucking computer science moron who does not know what a hash table is good for except security, who thinks a switch statement is if-then-else trees, sheep are so easily made fools by their admiration for complex shit.

God likes wit. Be charming.  Don't be earnest and dull.  Jacob tussled with God.  (God loved Jacob.)  Be yourself, though.

Earnest is usually tedious to listen to.  God never says anything obvious -- doesn't bother.  When you realize what a gift God's company is... 

If God is infinitely intelligent, you probably think, "I could never imagine it, it would be so glorious."

Guess what?  It has to sound like something.  If the answer is what everybody expects, it will sound pretty ordinary coming from God.  You'd say, "Huh.  I knew that.  Is that it?"  God doesn't do that.

Some common unions are declared in $LK,"Adam1a.HPP",A="MN:U16"$ for 1,2,4 and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration, that is the type when used by itself.  See $LK,"::/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP"$. 

* $FG,2$class$FG$ member vars can have meta data. $FG,2$fmtstr$FG$ and $FG,2$fmtdata$FG$ are two meta data types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the compiler's info about classes and vars.  See $LK,"::/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP"$ and  $LK,"DocFormDo",A="MN:DocFormDo"$().

* There is a keyword $FG,2$lastclass$FG$ you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class name of the previous arg.  See $LK,"ClassRep",A="MN:ClassRep"$().

* See $LK,"::/Demo/Exceptions.CPP"$.  $FG,2$try{} catch{}$FG$ and $FG,2$throw$FG$ are different from C++. $FG,2$throw$FG$ is a function with var ("$FG,2$...$FG$") args.  The values passed in $FG,2$throw()$FG$ can be accessed from within a $FG,2$catch{}$FG$ using the $FG,2$Fs->except_argc$FG$ and $FG,2$Fs->except_argv[]$FG$ vars.  Within a $FG,2$catch {}$FG$ blk, set the var $FG,2$Fs->catch_except$FG$ to $FG,2$TRUE$FG$ if you want to terminate the search for a handler.  By convention, the first arg of $FG,2$except_argv[]$FG$ specifies the exception type num.  A list of assigned exception types can be found at .  For a handler that will catch all excepts, you can use $LK,"PutExcept",A="MN:PutExcept"$().

* A function is available similar to $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ which provides the offset of a member of a class.  It's called $FG,2$offset$FG$.  You place the class name and member inside as in $FG,2$offset(classname.membername)$FG$.  It has nothing to do with 16-bit code.  Both $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ and $FG,2$offset$FG$ only accept one level of member vars.  That is, you can't do $FG,2$sizeof(classname.membername.submembername)$FG$.$FG$

* There is no $FG,2$continue$FG$ statement.  Use $FG,2$goto$FG$.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access $LK,"library routines",A="HI:Bit"$.

* $FG,2$lock{}$FG$ can be used to apply asm $FG,2$LOCK$FG$ prefixes to code for safe multicore read-modify-write accesses.  The code bracked with have $FG,2$LOCK$FG$ asm prefix's applied to relevant instructions within.  It's a little shoddy.  See $LK,"::/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP"$.

* There is a function called $LK,"MSize",A="MN:MSize"$() which gives the size of an object allocated off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to a power of two, so $FG,2$MSize()$FG$ lets you know the real size and you can take full advantage of it.

* You can $LK,"Free",A="MN:Free"$() a $FG,2$NULL$FG$ ptr.  Useful variants of $LK,"MAlloc",A="MN:MAlloc"$() can be found $LK,"Here",A="MN:CAlloc"$.  Each task has a heap and you can $FG,2$MAlloc$FG$ and $FG,2$Free$FG$ off of other task's heaps, or make an independent heap with $LK,"HeapCtrlBPInit",A="MN:HeapCtrlBPInit"$().

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change $LK,"DFT_STK",A="MN:DFT_STK"$ and recompile $FG,2$Kernel$FG$ or request more when doing a $LK,"Spawn",A="MN:Spawn"$().  You can use $LK,"CallStkGrow",A="MN:CallStkGrow"$(), but it's odd.  See $LK,"::/Demo/StkGrow.CPP"$. 

* Only one base class is allowed.

It kind of bothers me -- Elephants make no effort to eat ALL of what you set before them.  They behave as though it's grass in an infinite field and don't give a fuck.  I have noticed on pumpkins -- most of the pumpkin is wasted on the ground.  No fucks given.

I think elephants would drive Japanese people insane, LOL.

God says...
$FG,4$1:36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son
in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called
barren.

1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

1:39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with
haste, into a city of Juda; 1:40 And entered into the house of
Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.

1:41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of
Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the
Holy Ghost: 1:42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said,
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

1:43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come$FG$

OSDev guy suggests Linux.  I don't use any tools outside my OS -- I built them all.  I made a symbolic debugger.

My operating system is done.  I made a complete product that works on all 64-bit hardware.  My vision was a modern 64-bit Commodore 64.  I have gone quite past that and it is awesome.  Try it!  It's God's official temple.

This gets old.
