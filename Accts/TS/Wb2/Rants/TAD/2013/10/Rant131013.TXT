Yeah, I said Jews were "hideously viscious", like cornered animals.  I have become hideously-not-family-friendly.  I feel like I am a brutal movie that cannot be seen by kids.  I'll bet a lot of war veterans feel like they should be wearing a "unclean" sign, like a leper.

Sometimes, I wonder about Jesus and lepers.  If highs and lows balance, something dramatic happens around lepers.  No.  I don't know.  The real world evidence doesn't support that anything blessed happens to lepers.  However, Mary Poppins says, good luck will rub-off when you shakes hands with chimney sweeps. 

I thought about how America's statue of liberty says, "Send me your poor, huddled masses..."  Perhaps, everybody has rich and poor parts of their lives.  If we allow poor people to immigrate, then we ride the wave of their flip-side.  This sounds like a sacred secret -- good countries finish first for their blessedness, while the wicked Chinese barbarian countries only allow rich, skilled people in.

I dispise Chinese philosophy.  I hate it with a passion.  It is human rationalism instead of romanticism.  "Goliath will kill David unless he is clever."

looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

1:22 And of some have compassion, making a difference: 1:23 And others
save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment
spotted by the flesh.

1:24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
joy, 1:25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.$FG$


What I mean by "conceit" was something adults understand but not kids, in a kid's show.

I happened to think God doing children's programs would be the best videos He could make for all generations.  Just a thought.

I think a kids show should be for kids, not adults, so a harmless conceit is okay, but not if it interferes with the kids' benefit.

Yeah, God would seem to threaten jobs.  Don't worry -- He's not going to put anybody out of work.  Sadly, He doesn't want to do that.

$FG,4$9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he
burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished
the house.

9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.

9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

10:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard
questions.

10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when$FG$

So, if you need help interpreting...
"3 times a year" is similar to 184 day limit.
Branson is similar to Solomon when we interpret this.  Normally, I am Solomon, but not this time.
Solomon looks like a playboy in this passage, LOL.
Solomon had a fleet, lots of money...

Branson seems like a charasmatic guy who might be slightly a lightweight -- "hard questions" LOL

We want to enjoy God's company.  This is Heaven -- God being delightful.
