Someone at $TX,"WWW.OSDEV.ORG",HTML="http://www.osdev.org"$ is asking a question.

$FG,2$BTS$FG$,$FG,2$BTR$FG$,$FG,2$BT$FG$ are Intel x86 instructions.  My compiler has built-in "internal" functions which code those instructions.  My $FG,4$$TX,"Source Code By Address",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Accts/TS/Wb2/SymsAddress.html"$$FG$ table shows the meaningless internal numbers for internal, built-into-compiler functions.

TempleOS is identity-mapped.  It is not the case that user programs run at address zero, like every other operating system.  Applications do not have a standard address map -- their memory for code and data and stack is all over the place because the kernel simply requests memory from the system $LK,"MAlloc",A="MN:MAlloc"$().  Virtual addresses are set equal to physical addresses.  Therefore, if two applications are running, the kernel must place them at different addresses and they run from different addresses.

Technically, all code is allocated in the lowest 2-gig range of addresses, so that the x86 CALL REL32 for everything.

Binary files have a table of offsets which must be patched so that they are absolute addresses.

The BBC was talking about breathy singing and instruments.  Sometimes, God says a lot of noise for only a word or two of signal.  A single word or phrase, however, can convey a lot.

I like to remind people that if SETI only got a signal once every five years, we would still listen.

Generally, however, it is true that if you offer a better offering, you get a better response and a dud or lots of noise means your offering was not pleasing.

A person at OSDev thinks I use Visual C or gcc.

I wrote my own compiler and assembler.  I wrote everything.

I am the best programmer on the planet -- that's why God chose me to make His temple.  I took 5 asm courses in school and a compiler course and operating systems course.  I got a degree in computer systems engineering and I have been a professional operating system developer since 1990 when I was hired at age 20 to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system in VAX assembly language.  At Ticketmaster, one guy wrote our PASCAL compiler and one guy wrote our assembler and linker.  I am old and old computer people frequently wrote compilers and nobody doubted.  You young people cannot imagine anyone writing a compiler because visual C and gcc are such a beasts.

My compiler is 20,000 lines of code.  It compiles $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ and produces just x86_64 machine code, but operates both JIT or AOT.

There are no object files.  There are two modules compiled ahead of time, KERNEL.BIN and COMPILER.BIN.  You are discouraged from compiling anything else ahead of time.  Everything should be compiled just-in-time.  Compiling during boot, I consider just-in-time.

KERNEL.BIN and COMPILER.BIN add-up to 50,000 lines of code.  It takes one second to compile both, together.

During boot another 50,000 lines of code are compiled.  It takes one second.

In other words, all user programs should be executed by pressing F5 in the editor, more or less.  No OBJ and no EXE files, even exist. (You run them from the command-line, too, but it's more or less like pressing F5 in the editor.)

It's too bad software interrupts are so slow.  They are neat because the instructions take just 2 bytes.  I have a ring-0-only operating system that makes sense because it is faster and would not make as much sense if it was slow and did privilege level changes!  I use CALL REL32 for all calls.
