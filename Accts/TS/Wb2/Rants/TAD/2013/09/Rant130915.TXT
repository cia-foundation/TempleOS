First, trust me that I am smarter than anyone you know.

I started in TASM and wrote an interpreter for my command-line in the first month -- 2004.  Over the next ten years, full-time, I made it into an optimizing JIT or AOT x86_64 compiler.  All of you make the command-line like Linux.  You are young and never saw a C64, and you are stupid, so you cannot imagine anything but Linux command-line.  My generation all learned 6502 assembly language.  Seriously.  We all used DOS interrupts when DOS was common.  Turbo C had an "interrupt" key word for interrupt routines.  I put an "interrupt" key word in my compiler, so it saves regs and returns with IRET.

Did I not tell you I was smarter and anyone you know.  Do you think MikeOS is as smart as making a compiler with an "interrupt" keyword?  No.  He's not a smart man.  All the smart people who knew assembly stopped using it, for good reason.  Do you doubt this?  Do I need to beat you until you stop this nonsense thinking assembly is good when the whole smart world stopped using it?  You think MikeOS guy is smarter than all of my generation who learned asm and stopped using it?

Let me explain.  This is programmer psychology:  Assembly is the opposite of nigger.  Interrupt is the opposite of nigger.  Polling is for niggers.

Some people were told this and have no clue why and simply have no judgement on when asm is good, when polling is good, when interrupts are good -- they are sure it's for niggers.

I took 5 assembly classes.

CSC226 was Intel x86 assembly.  We made a B8000 window manager similar to Borland's IDE.

CSC326 was Intel x86 assembly part II.  We had a lab.  We programmed PIC and PIT in all configurations, including non-IBM-PC PIC modes.  We scanned keypad grids with I/O and we made 7-segment displays operate by strobing them in sequence.

CSC421 was Motorola 6800 assembly for embedded systems.  It was an 8-bit CPU similar to a 6502.  We learned what every instruction did.  We did scaled fixed-point math for Feirenheight to Celsius, like you might find on a thermocouple in a car engine.  Motorola made chips for cars.

CSC422 was M6800, hardware.  We learned the digital logic for gluing M6800.  It had two processors on high and low memory cycles, one for I/O.

CSC523 was M6800 part III.  We were graded on a curve on how short our assembly programs were.  I got an A.  Our last 2-week project was a multitasking scheduler.

CSC120 was digital logic.  We made a simulated CPU from scratch, including microcode and stuff.

CSC330 was computer architecture.  We learned the harvard bus or whatever -- microcode and stuff.

I took a compiler course.

I took an operating system course.

I took a computer graphics course.  We made a 3D package from scratch.  We studied bezier and bsplines.

I took a numeric methods course.  I know the hidden bit.

80x86 for PC half of file compression package I did.  I also did it in VAX assembly.
68000 I did a barcode reader networking device.  I found bugs in TMNet a networking device.  I did a bar code reader image processor.
8051  I did a wall line voltage regulator.  I modified a stepper motor controller at Xytec.

PIC (tiny 8-bit microcontroller by MicroChip) -- made a bogus EEPROM to fool a printer/copier to allow refilling toner.
Atmel AVR -- Did an experimental toner level sensor, that didn't see production.

I just discovered something.  The editor $LK,"MAlloc",A="MN:MAlloc"$()s memory for text when you print to the command-line.  It has a limit on number of entries, not quite number of line, but similar.  It doesn't check the count and delete very frequently.  It only checks sometimes -- when the window is drawn at 60Hz.

I discovered something funny.  If you have a task printing to the command-line and the window is completely covered, the limit on number of entries is never checked and text entries in the buffer are never deleted, so hidden windows printing lots of text will buffer it all and run the system out of memory.

The optimization is too glorious to change.  We'll chalk this up to, "Hey!  It's a Commodore 64, not a system critical multi-user mainframe!  Just don't do that."

There's nothing shady about this.  Linux is a 1970's mainframe with 2 Meg RAM for 100 users; mine is a modern C64 with 8 Gig that practically doesn't need to free memory, if there is some speed advantage to be gained.

Fucken monkeys think I'm like Tyson with too much money, or, in my case, memory.

If I offered you a modern Windows that runs on a 486 and 10 Meg or one which requires a Pentium and 512 Meg, which is better?  Nobody cares if you went to heroic measures to get old hardware to work.  The market belongs to cutting edge systems that get some benefit, any benefit, out of modern hardware.  If I can increase buffer sizes and not check them as frequently with more memory, that is brilliant.  Any retard can make the buffers small, paranoid that 1000 main frame users will log-on.  A main frame operating system has negative trade-offs compared to a modern C64 vision.

$IV,1$----09/15/13 13:33:10----$IV,0$

My vision of a C64 is brilliant.  Just imagine the benefitial trade-offs gained from:

  1) It's okay if sometimes crashes because we are single-user, not multi-user.

  2) It's okay if it can't do some stuff.  Use Windows or Linux.

  3) Optimize for full-screen, single user, focus-task-all-important.

It's at least three orders of magnitude simpler and performance is better!  Tell me why performance would be worse.  Obviously, it would be better!  Protections only come into play when you do something abnormal.  Protections slow everything down.

A wise man knows trade-offs mean you give-up one thing, you get something else.  Do the math on what is gained!  Yer a brainwashed retard-monkey-sheep, probably.

In the summer after 8th grade in 1984, I wrote a line draw routine for the Commodore 64 in 6502 assembly language doing MUL and DIV by hand.  I figured-out I needed fixed-point math, calculated the slope.
