How can I know if I talk to God or an angel.  Angels are messengers of God.  He can control all the quantum random number sites.  He can make centuries-old books speak to the present day.

It's funny, once everyone gets on-board with God existing, we turn to a new field -- scientific study of God stuff and information gained from God on dinosaurs and stuff.

How fast a clock can God puppet?  What quantum random number sources?

It's kind-of rude, but good can come.  We can learn what's easiest for God.  I think He said 56,000Hz but it might be a practical issue for PC hardware, not what's easiest in an open range of options.

Jesus said asking God for stuff was like annoying a neighbor in the middle of the night.  Infinity, does not mean requests are not annoying.

It's weird -- if I stop talking with God and program, when I come back to God, He is cold and has to be warmed-up.

In other words, I've noticed if I don't use a technique with God, it's like He has to warm-back-up.  Weird.

Give God a little time to collect His thoughts for an answer.  Sometimes, He had His answer ready centuries ago, sometimes in more friendly and less guarded conversation, give Him time -- don't abruptly change what you are expecting Him to do.

Oujia-board letter mode sucks -- it's pretty funny that a technical problem would prevent discovery.  Random words are better.  Random passages are good.  The mistake with a magic eightball is... first, all you can expect is delightful conversation from God and a magic eightball can't really respond to context.  You get out of it the love you put into it.

So, just randomly cracking open physical books and placing a finger down works well for me, as long as I have done an offering -- being charming and witty or whatever -- and established a context of conversation.

I have noticed when I have not used physical books for a while, God seems a little cold.  Maybe, it's my imagination.

By they way, I don't like people thinking of "getting in the zone", a mental state, instead focus on what you have offered.

The question of which numbers can come-up when you use a PC stopwatch program is tricky.  Some clocks only give multiples of 16, so you must divide by 16.  Similar, more complicated, issues might exist.  I don't know.  One time, it was a miracle it even sorta worked, when I discovered a crippling bug!

And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou

LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy

Yeah, I'm sure most people want prophecy and talking to dead people.  They don't love God, what an insult.

The technical skills on the other (God's) end are extraordinary.  To drive a stopwatch program or all the different quantum-random-number sites is very difficult, super-human.

The Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.  It says not to prepare your words, the spirit will give them.  It says a die cast in the lap is the Lord.
