In terms of what purpose it is built for, the vision for Linux is a multi-user mainframe, with full protections against crashing.  The vision for TempleOS is a modern Commodore 64.  That is, I made TempleOS to serve the same niche as a Commodore 64.

The C64 came with a manual full of BASIC programs that told how to make binary sprite DATA statements in a BASIC program.

TempleOS identity-maps memory.  Memory will fragment.  It is a kayak, not a Titanic.  Just reboot.  Making a complete back-up is simple.  Just reinstall.  Do a few fire drills, so it is second nature, and you will have amazing peace of mind.
