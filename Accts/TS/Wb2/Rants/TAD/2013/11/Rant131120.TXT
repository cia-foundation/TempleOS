You know what would be funny?  It would be funny if I had just Chinese customers emailing me.  I would squirm a little.  I'm surprised the CIA hasn't tortured me in that way.  I can get big headed and worried.  It's nothing difficult, yet it is impressive.

I live in a small number of websites, probably all done by the CIA.  There are no programmers in my league... but I know in the world that there are others.  Lots of people would look at the simple stuff I did and think it nothing.

To me... My operating system gives me the same feeling.... It's like when you sit down to a Motorola 68020 device with no operating system and start coding fresh.  There is nothing you don't need and if you are doing it fresh, it is perfect and clean.  There is no ugly code.  At the beginning, it is all simple, clean, fresh.  My operating system seems like nothing, to me, as I imagine writing for a 68020 -- it is libraries but these aren't ugly, they are just simple libraries.  I imagine PUTCHAR.  I imagine PUTHEX.  When I think of my operating system, it seems like nothing but these perfect little routines I am so familiar with... there is nothing I don't understand.

When I think of my operating system, I kinda have an impression of PUTCHAR and PUTHEX and nothing more.  Am I making sense?

It's like an excited Indian is telling me, "You must have ice in your soda.  It is not acceptible to drink soda without ice.  Absolutely, you must have ice in your soda."  He is very excited about this and sure of himself.

To these Indian guys, Ring-0-only and identity-mapping, is blasphemy to them.  To me it's like not having ice in my soda.  (This is not my concern)  The ice delutes it.  Privilege level changes slow it down and make it complicated.  You don't have to have protections and it will be faster and simpler.  It's just like not having ice in your soda.  Some people really freak-out.  Look, dude, you don't own the store, why do you care?  The store doesn't care, much.

I take ice in my soda, actually, but it's like that.

These people are really freaked-out that I don't have ice in my soda.  I'm tired of talking to them.  We argue year after year.  "You must have ice in your soda."  I'm not buying it from a store.

I have way too much ego.  I have to remind myself by watching this video of a gulf natural gas processing platform.  There's a square block of pipes and complicated stuff that they park above the ocean in the gulf.  They run these pipes all over the bottom with ships miles above the floor.

When I think about all that stuff, it seems silly worrying if the Chinese are taking a ring-0-only operating system.  Someone tries to raise the specter of killer robots.  Come-on!  That oil platform makes my thing look puny.

In 64-bit long mode, to call a nearby routine there is a short, fast 32-bit instruction.  It gets slightly uglier when you want to go anywhere in 64-bit range.

There are countless inside-the-box assumptions, all the stupid people I deal with hold.  "Everything grows.  If you make a limit it will be exceeded.  Bill Gates said 640K would be enough, what an idiot, ba ha."  Bill Gates was accepted to Harvard and was pretty damn smart.  All the kids make fun of him.  We all know 2 Gig is just like 640K.  We're not stupid, like Bill Gates.  It's obvious, now, that no number will be enough, because of Moores law.  Moores law cannot be violated.  That's like the speed of light changing.

I say 2 Gig will be enough for code, for my operating system.

My operating system will always be changed to fix imperfections.  Most people promise backward compatibility?  I promise the opposite, LOL.  I will ALWAYS break backward compatibility to keep it perfect.  That's a promise.  I won't think twice.  Who knows -- maybe it's perfect, now, though.

I really want to remove support for FAT32 and ISO9660.  I have a simple filesystem called "RedSea" that I want Windows and Linux to support.  Not only can RedSea work on hard disk, it can work as CD/DVD by just putting the image there.  

The RedSea file system is just like FAT32 but it has an allocation bitmap instead of FAT.  It can only have contiguous files and files cannot change size to get bigger.  This is not suitable, normally, but for us it's okay.  An additional difference is that the directory entries are fixed-size and limited filename length.  They are 64-byte entries with 38 length including a zero.

Our goal is to be obnoxiously simple.  That's what we live for.  I wake-up every day trying to find more ways to be obnoxiously simple.

A CDROM need not have an allocation bitmap.  Oops, I forgot -- I was not even thinking about multi-session CDDVD burning.

There are probably times I am not obnoxiously simple.  I don't care.

I am certainly not low resource usage.  Quite the contrary.  I like to use resources to make it obnoxiously simple.  When hardware gets more powerful, some new possibilities open-up.  Almost all the time, I load and save whole files at once.  Traditional file-to-disk virtual memory is obsolete.  Have you ever actually triggered it and seen how unacceptibly slow it is!  If the guide is SWAP equal to RAM size, heck for a factor of two more memory, just buy more memory.  I can understand virtual memory for a factor of ten more memory but a factor of two more memory, just makes no sense because it's so terrible.

Once we calm down, you might soon decide my operating system is no news at all.  I'm not keen on the thought of helping drones, so I'm relieved if mine's not hard-real-time.  If you think about it, ring-0-only is not the issue, it's simplicity.  People can do hardware in Linux, but mine is simpler.

I remember the nice, clean, architecture of a Motorola 68020 and starting a fresh assembly project with no other code.  That is not sinister.

God said we are being moved-off our ancestrial lands.

So, the horsepower is higher, good for cameras, I guess.

In the past, I would have sought to do robots, and would have tried to make them good, as in scary.  I played with a dremel tool on a stepper motor platform.  I scratched that itch.  I have no plans and shit is too hard.

Shit is much harder to hook-up.  It used to be simple to do an RS232 serial port driver.  Now, sheesh!  <shakes his head>  USB is insanely overengineered.  Ethernet?  Camera?  I don't have any plans for hardware.

Young men should have the feeling of starting fresh on a Motorola 68020 in assembly language.  Not literally, but approximately.
