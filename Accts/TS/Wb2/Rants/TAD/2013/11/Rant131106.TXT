My compiler makes x86_64 machine code, not byte code.  Did you not know that a compiler parses and makes an intermediate code data structure?  What do you think an optimization stage works on?  After optimizing, it converts the intermediate code to output machine code.

My compiler makes a stack machine intermediate code.  Most compilers make an abstract symbol tree intermediate code.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to just blocks on RedSea.)

3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.

4) No secure boot.

5) ATA/ATAPI PIO must work

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to real hardware.

In this country, we do not tolerate errors in singing our national anthem.  What a horror if a person sang the wrong words, or something.

You are a better man than I, if you are not distracted by bad code.

I don't like type checking.

I think the concensus is kids should not be bossed around too much -- they are delicate and need positive reinforcement.  I don't know if that's true.  I pictured kids making crazy mods to my code for fun, not added to the official code.

I feel slightly ridiculous with 16 colors and not 256.  I think that's how God wants it, though.  Maybe, we can get confirmation.

It is permanently limited to 100,000 lines of code, forever.  Future generations can do GPU support if all chips converge on one design.  God said 640x480 16 color, though.

You know how you fucken removed the ability to burn ISO files to CDROM and made secure boot?  Undo that.  You know you no longer burn ISO9660 files.  Guess what?  You're going to support my RedSea files system for hard drives and CDROMs.  It's super-simple, but high, modern, capacity.

God wants His temple perfect. FAT32 is not perfect.

The rule for God's temple is we ALWAYs change it to be perfect at the expense of backward compatibility.

By making Windows and Linux use RedSea file system, I can remove ISO9660 and and FAT32 support from God's temple, making it more perfect and freeing-up 1000 lines of code.

The BMP file format is not perfect.  We want .GRA file support with my LZW compression on files ending in Z.
