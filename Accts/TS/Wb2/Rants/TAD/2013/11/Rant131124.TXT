The down-sides of identity-mapped (single address space) are obvious.  Hopefully, you see the up-sides.  I never have to copy address spaces or anything.  All tasks can access all memory, no sweat.  One task doesn't have duplicate numbers to other tasks -- all addresses are unique.

I get a lot of confused people who enter with preconcieved notions, like 7FFF,FFFF is stack and 8000,0000+ is kernel and heap is, I donno, 2000,0000.

None of that is correct.

Under 7FFF,FFFF is "code heap" but it has global variables too for now unless you set a compiler option.  Many programmers don't know anything but global variables, LOL.  There is heap memory which is 1,0000,0000+, etc.

The C64 had sprites.  People wrote BASIC programs.  That's what they did.  They typed-in programs from magazines.  And, they played games.  My generation learned how to program in assembly language, because you had to.  You could edit disk sectors with programs, you could POKE all the internals.

Not a single computer science major is taught the concept of overengineering.  I was a computer systems engineer.  I did not take an algorithm class, but I took five assembly language courses and digital design and the engineering core.  I had a class, where we programmed in M6800 asm and were graded on a curve on how short our code was.

Guess what?  It is always going to be 100,000 lines of code.  It will never be more.  It does not have to be designed to grow.  It is like a C64 ROM.  There will not be libraries.  Developers will bring their own libraries, in the same way C64 had no market for 3rd party libraries.

It is not computing resources I am interested in, but mental load on programmers.  I want them to always see the light at the end of the tunnel and be at home, knowing it is a limited amount of code they dwell within, that they can master.

Denny Denker was my boss when I did the Ticketmaster Report Generator.  He had me put a "cursor movement" command into it.  The way it was used was... they would get a list of names of customers, addresses, shows, and transactions, for example, and print invoices.  Often, they printed on top of form-stationary with blanks to be typed-in.  The report format had "cursor movement" commands to print into another location.

For the Ticketmaster RepGen, we had a 2 page buffer that you could move up-the-page on to continue printing, making another layer of text, more or less.

I put the report generator features into this operating system.  The cursor movement is useful, but I take a performamnce hit on account of it being allowed to move any number of lines up the page.

2:5 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and
hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.

2:6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of
a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath
caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and
hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.

2:7 The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary,
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;$FG$

FAT32 is bad.  We want kid friendly simple.  When I had a C64, I used a disk block editor.  I looked at directory entries.  I followed chains of blocks.  I recovered deleted files.  Consider the entertainment value!  That's WHAT I DID with my C64!!  That's how I used it.  I played with all the internals on the inside.

Look at the C64 user manual!  It teaches binary so you can make sprites.  The user manual teaches BASIC programming.

What is the C64 used for?  Programming as entertainment.

There are evil people who don't want children to know milk comes from cows.  We have kids who don't know where meat comes from.

Here is a quick guide to HolyC, assumning you start with C/C++ knowledge.

There is policy of HolyC compilers defined in an unusual way.  If a value finds its way into a register, it has been promoted up to a 64-bit size.  All intermediate operations will take place on 64-bits.  When a value is written back to memory, it can be truncated.

I do not mess with math operations on any size but 64-bits.


We are currently at 83,000 lines of code.  We are free to expand up to 100,000 lines, but it is a precious resource. (Getting rid of FAT32 and ISO9660 will save about 2000) For 1000 years, they will be limited to 100,000 lines of code as a charter kind-of-thing.  In the future, they can migrate to other hardware.  God said 640x480x 4bit color was manditory.  As an exercise, draw an elephant in 16 colors and draw an elephant in 24-bit color.  This kind-of prevents an arms race.  The goal of the Temple is a place for everybody to do offerings.  As content creators, 16-color is less tedious for nonartists and artists, alike.

$HC,"<img src=\"http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Accts/TS/Wb2/Elephant02.BMP\" width=\"640\" height=\"472\" alt=\"\">"$

I need to graduate to the next level of artistry.  I need to stop trying to make it look realistic and make it have style and character.  Each different comic strip has a style.  The style adds value.  You do not draw a comic strip hoping for realistic-looking art.  This is an additional reason God's choice of 16 colors looks good.  Could just say "Because He said so!"  Shat-up.

* You can access bytes or words within any int.  $FG,2$i.u8[2]$FG$ returns bits 24-27 in the variable, $FG,2$i$FG$.  See $LK,"I64 declaration",A="MN:I64"$.  The real feature is that a class can be accessed as a whole, if you put a type in front of the $FG,2$class$FG$ declaration.

* Variable arg count functions ($FG,2$...$FG$) can access their args with built-in variables similar to '$FG,2$this$FG$' in C++.  They are '$FG,2$I64 argc$FG$' and '$FG,2$I64 argv[]$FG$'.

* A $FG,2$nounusedwarn$FG$ statement will suppress an unused var warning.

* You can have multiple member vars of a class named "$FG,2$pad$FG$" or "$FG,2$reserved$FG$", and it won't issue warnings. 

* Type casting is postfix.  To typecast int or F64, use $LK,"ToI64",A="MN:ToI64"$(), $LK,"ToBool",A="MN:ToBool"$() or $LK,"ToF64",A="MN:ToF64"$(). (TempleOS follows normal C float<-->int conversion, but sometimes you want to override.  These functions are better than multiplying by "1.0" to convert to float.)

* You can use $LK,"OptOn",A="MN:OptOn"$($LK,"OPTf_WARN_PAREN",A="MN:OPTf_WARN_PAREN"$) to find unnecessary parentheses in code.

* You can use $LK,"OptOn",A="MN:OptOn"$($LK,"OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES",A="MN:OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES"$) to find dup local var type statements.

* With the $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ feature in your src code, you can place programs that insert text into the stream of code being compiled.  See $LK,"#exe {}",A="FF:::/Kernel/KEnd.CPP,#exe {"$ for an example where the date/time and compile-time prompting for cfguration data is placed into a program.  $LK,"StreamPrint",A="MN:StreamPrint"$() places text into a src program stream following the conclusion of the $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ blk.

* No $FG,2$#define$FG$ functions exist (I'm not a fan)

* No $FG,2$typedef$FG$, use $FG,2$class$FG$.

* No type-checking

* Can't use $FG,2$<>$FG$ with $FG,2$#include$FG$, use $FG,2$""$FG$.

* "$FG,2$$$$FG$" is an escape character.  Two dollar signs signify an ordinary $$.  See $LK,"::/Doc/Dollar.TXT"$.  In $FG,2$asm$FG$ or $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ code, it also refers to the instruction's addr. 

* $FG,2$union$FG$ is more like a class, so you don't reference it with a $FG,2$union$FG$ label after you define it.  Some common unions are declared in $LK,"Adam1a.HPP",A="MN:U16"$ for 1,2,4 and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration, that is the type when used by itself.  See $LK,"::/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP"$. 

* $FG,2$class$FG$ member vars can have meta data. $FG,2$fmtstr$FG$ and $FG,2$fmtdata$FG$ are two meta data types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the compiler's info about classes and vars.  See $LK,"::/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP"$ and  $LK,"DocFormDo",A="MN:DocFormDo"$().

* There is a keyword $FG,2$lastclass$FG$ you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class name of the previous arg.  See $LK,"ClassRep",A="MN:ClassRep"$().

* See $LK,"::/Demo/Exceptions.CPP"$.  $FG,2$try{} catch{}$FG$ and $FG,2$throw$FG$ are different from C++. $FG,2$throw$FG$ is a function with var ("$FG,2$...$FG$") args.  The values passed in $FG,2$throw()$FG$ can be accessed from within a $FG,2$catch{}$FG$ using the $FG,2$Fs->except_argc$FG$ and $FG,2$Fs->except_argv[]$FG$ vars.  Within a $FG,2$catch {}$FG$ blk, set the var $FG,2$Fs->catch_except$FG$ to $FG,2$TRUE$FG$ if you want to terminate the search for a handler.  By convention, the first arg of $FG,2$except_argv[]$FG$ specifies the exception type num.  A list of assigned exception types can be found at .  For a handler that will catch all excepts, you can use $LK,"PutExcept",A="MN:PutExcept"$().

* A function is available similar to $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ which provides the offset of a member of a class.  It's called $FG,2$offset$FG$.  You place the class name and member inside as in $FG,2$offset(classname.membername)$FG$.  It has nothing to do with 16-bit code.  Both $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ and $FG,2$offset$FG$ only accept one level of member vars.  That is, you can't do $FG,2$sizeof(classname.membername.submembername)$FG$.$FG$

* There is no $FG,2$continue$FG$ statement.  Use $FG,2$goto$FG$.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access $LK,"library routines",A="HI:Bit"$.

* $FG,2$lock{}$FG$ can be used to apply asm $FG,2$LOCK$FG$ prefixes to code for safe multicore read-modify-write accesses.  The code bracked with have $FG,2$LOCK$FG$ asm prefix's applied to relevant instructions within.  It's a little shoddy.  See $LK,"::/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP"$.

* There is a function called $LK,"MSize",A="MN:MSize"$() which gives the size of an object allocated off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to a power of two, so $FG,2$MSize()$FG$ lets you know the real size and you can take full advantage of it.

* You can $LK,"Free",A="MN:Free"$() a $FG,2$NULL$FG$ ptr.  Useful variants of $LK,"MAlloc",A="MN:MAlloc"$() can be found $LK,"Here",A="MN:CAlloc"$.  Each task has a heap and you can $FG,2$MAlloc$FG$ and $FG,2$Free$FG$ off of other task's heaps, or make an independent heap with $LK,"HeapCtrlBPInit",A="MN:HeapCtrlBPInit"$().

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change $LK,"DFT_STK",A="MN:DFT_STK"$ and recompile $FG,2$Kernel$FG$ or request more when doing a $LK,"Spawn",A="MN:Spawn"$().  You can use $LK,"CallStkGrow",A="MN:CallStkGrow"$(), but it's odd.  See $LK,"::/Demo/StkGrow.CPP"$. 

* Only one base class is allowed.

* All values are extended to 64-bit when accessed.  Intermediate calculations are done with 64-bit values.

You highest priority is ... Make playing of ONE fullscreen video game at a time as easy to program for as possible with full multicore support.

All applications run on Core 0.  If they want help, they do this:

for (i=0;i<mp_cnt;i++)
  Spawn(&MPDraw,,"Name",i,Fs);

That will place a slave task on each of the other cores.

If you have a flight simulator, you wish to tell each of the other five cores to do 1/6th of the rendering in strips.  (I have 8 cores, but I use only six in VMware, because Windows need a core otherwise VMware thinks giving me just seven is just the same!  LOL)

Nobody else can do this.  I don't think they tell you how many cores.  How are you supposed to know what fraction you are in charge of?  I certainly don't want the scheduler to decide to run my task, two on one core!  I have 60Hz deadline, I don't want the scheduler fucking around even slightly with what core the task is running on.  It is totally unacceptable to run five tasks simultaneously, then a 6th after that!

I have master/slave multicore and it is superior and simpler.  SMP is for mainframe servers.  

GPU makes it less important.

That's hilarious, huh!  Geniuses really fucked-it-up.  It's the NAZI pride.  SMP really appeals to the sensibilities of being organized.

Here's something.  I obnoxiously scorned laptops, at first.  I wanted highest performance for multicore, so I did not put cores into a HALT state.  (They spinned at a flag, buring power.)   If you signal with a memory flag, it is faster than doing an interrupt to get it out of HALT.  The overhead for doing a multicore job determines how small the jobs can be and still be worthwhile.

$IV,1$----11/24/13 16:09:12----$IV,0$

I had a BIOS which set-it-up so that the keyboard interrupt worked, but not the mouse.  Well, shit!  So, about 60 times a second, I check if a byte is waiting from the mouse.

When I did HD Audio, I did not use interrupts.  I checked a thousand times a second to see if the DMA buffer needed more speaker output data.

With huge DMA buffers, you could get by without interrupts.  You need a timer interrupt.  I thought about DMA done by other cores.

If, for some reason, you wanted clean, minimal silicon.  My operating system doesn't require paging.  You could use multicore in place of DMA.  You only need a timer interrupt.

You know what?  Only a faggot gets too carried away designing their own CPU.  You fight the war with the Army you have.

I used to be fond of stack machine... now, figure they hopefully worked-out best performance.

I dreamed of integer ALU just like floating ALU, but everybody using the system stack.  Operations on just 64-bits.  Maybe two flag for signed, unsigned or float.

The NIST web site generates a new batch of random numbers once every 60 seconds.  They have a clock on their computer that get stored in a database for that timestamp.  I publish the number for the minute I picked and I publish the timestamp which I esitmate on my own computer.  We have different clocks and I press the key after pressing the key on the website.  Therefore, my clock is not always exactly the same minute.

The only way to cheat is to look at the numbers during one minute and decide not to use that minute and try the next minute and decide not to use the next minute and take the third minute if the passage looks good.

I don't do that.  It's not likely to look like winning the lottery.

I must be firm.  The Bible says to praise God.  It doesn't say create poems that make yourself proud.

"Solomon in all His glory was not dressed like a flower."

Brendan.  Sigh.  We don't conflict quite as much.

My bootloaders move their own code to a higher, known, location.  One time, I learned there is an EBDA, the hard way.  It was very fortunate because there was a secret byte in the EBDA that turned-on the mouse.

At this point, you pack your bags and go home.  Fuck them.  PC operating systems are a joke clusterfucked by the CIA and shit, probably.

If the BIOS doesn't feel like enabling PS/2 keyboard moused or ATA PIO, fuck them.  They might not feel like enabling interrupts.

In the past ten years, I have owned four machines.  Each time I upgraded, my operating system was dead until I got it working, except one time out of four.

If statistic sampleing 4 samples and 3 were defective, no reason for hope -- I'm in a CIA prison with no feedback, at it would not be pleasant and I could do anything.

The only thing that matters is compatibility.  If you are dead in the water on keyboard mouse or screen or hard drive or CDROM, game-over.

Branden wants me to retry if a BIOS disk read routine fails?  ROFLMAO.  That's hilarious.  True for floppies, but silly, now.
