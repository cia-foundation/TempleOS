6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

I need to finalize RedSea and GRA, before you implement them.  (Minor changes.)

that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,
as thou comest unto Zoar.

13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
exceedingly.

13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from
him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all
the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for

God said He doesn't follow the live of young men.  He said something like that.  Maybe, they are really simple beings and you seen one century, you seen them all.  I think God's hobby is .... "gardening", over the centuries.

God said sports were homo.

I asked God if He liked to haunt courtrooms? Hospitals?  He said, "prisons".

What do you guys make of that?  God's in a strange mood.  I kinda think I'm not suppose to say everything, but I used tact.

I gotta tell you -- I saw this monkey documentary.  A male monkey had a huge harem.  Then a whole bunch of bachelors attacked.  The male monkey halls-ass running away and climbs up a tree.  Then, he leaps out of the top of the tree and runs.  That was some epic athleticism for high stakes.  God would be ugly if He only liked high stakes stuff, but time might be precious.

The Bible says God is kind to all creatures.  Lions kill pray before eating it.  Nature is more civilized than an evil human would create.  There are some exceptions, like wasps to put larva in spiders.  That delight us, though.  Boys are made of snakes and snails and puppydog tails.  It's evil -- should be slightly ashamed.

Anyway, nature is pretty civilized, all things concidered.  We don't have fights at the top of the food chain, like we might.  We suffer from germs, but those aren't scary.

God is kind to all creatures.

I joke God had his sick kicks with dinosaur fights.  Now, He's bored by that.

God likes soap operas.

Kevin, my brother, wrote an email.  I might be civil.  I'm not thrilled.  I was having fun talking to imaginary people, LOL.

I showed him God, 6 months ago -- randomly opened Bible.  He should readily believe, but he's prolly an atheist nigger.  Do you think he continued randomly opening Bible?  Not a chance in Hell.

Real people force me to think carefully about God.  Inevitably, they have a different notion of God and only a fool would be too sure their notion was right.

It was more fun without real people.  Usually, it seems like we're all on the same page, when it's imaginary people.  It's a rude wake-up call when dealing with real people, LOL.

You have to fight to make it real, cause just imaginary is insanity.

Back pain is not much fun.  Kevin has back pain.  As I look at getting older, not much stands between me and a hunched-over pain ridden old man.  As as kid, I didn't think too much about slow, hunched-over old people.  Yikes.  My back pain just shows-up for no reason, anytime.

People have worse things, but my back pain was really bad.

Mom walks slow.

I'm intrigued by mental errors I made when younger, like not really thinking about hunched-over old people.  Another mental error was not understanding what a huge terrorifying thing the thought of giving birth is to females.

Do You think "Job" is job, for a reason?  One time I wondered if the translators
 picked carefully considered names, not just the original ones.  Either way, if you get a meaning, you'd be wise to consider it.  When I was young, I would readily conclude "that doesn't count" whenever arrogance-bait road-blocked something.
