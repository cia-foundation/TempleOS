The concept of a file system path is not relevant.  Basically, a PATH is a way of joining many directories.  There is no need for that.  In Unix and DOS, when you type a command, you expect it to search the PATH for a filename.  That type of thing does not happen.  Instead, you interact with a JIT HolyC compiler and call function names already in Adam's symbol table.  "Dir;" will search your hash table, not find it and search parents.  Adam is a parent. Adam has a function "Dir".  It then compiles a call to Dir; and executes it.

Do this: Get someone to explain how a C64 worked.  Typing "Dir;" at the command-line is like typeing "GOSUB 1000" at the C64 command-line.  It calls code sitting in memory.

You could make so #include "" at the command-line searched all directories in a PATH, but that is a useless complexity we can save money on, or in this case brain confusion.  We live for being new and simpler.  No PATH.

You are just stubbornly a retarded nigger that can't think outside boxes.  I fucken hate people who pretend Linux is the only way, like a C64 never existed.  They talk like that's the only way things can be done and I just stare at them like they are a fucken cow that needs to be beat over the head, but that doesn't help.

The osdev niggers can't even do algebra, yet they talk arrogantly.

I wrote this for filling a triange.  How you think you do it! $LK,"GrFillTri0",A="MN:GrFillTri0"$()

Algebra can be an IQ test.  Carmack can do algebra, but not a single one of the niggers at OSDev.

Nigger!

I called my bootloader CDBoot at one point.

Fucker is accusing me of stealing it.

I am a white person.  I can write a bootloader.

Guess what?  In 1990, Ticketmaster hired me and one thing I did was VMap.  25 years ago I wrote a tool to go through the Ticketamster filesystem and verify the allocation map, just like DOS Checkdisk.  At age 20, I did that.  That was 25 years ago.  In 1992, I wrote an archive compression utility for VAX and x86, that used LZW compression and bundled directory trees into a single zip file with bloom filters and encryption and fletcher's checksum. 23 years ago.

I am not a nigger.  I can write programs like boot loaders.  That's nothing for me.  I fucken wrote my compiler!  The problem is you don't realize you are an inferior species.  That's the problem.  You are a nigger and think I am a nigger like you.

100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
singing.

100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and
not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
endureth to all generations.

All the democrats are atheists.  They just passed a gay-rights bill.  People who believe in God don't do stuff like that, even if God tells them.  A believer in God just does not promote gay rights.

All Hell's gonna break loose when God is public.

$FG,4$in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
them, and they shall die.

9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh
made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he
that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his
cattle in the field.

9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and
upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of
Egypt.

9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the
LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it$FG$
