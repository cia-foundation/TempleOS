I used dumb terminals connected to Cray Supercomputers when I was in school.

Good luck.

I can do real-time multicore no other operating system can do.  They can run 8 people at once but not one task 8 times as fast (in terms you can understand).

I don't do SMP.  I put apps on core#0, they ask how many cores available and divide the rendering into strips, then each core does part of the scene and ll have to finish withing 16 mS  : 60Hz

Nobody else can do that.

Good luck explaining it.  Every body is brainwashed.

So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.

29:36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared
the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

30:1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also
to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the
LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.

30:2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.

30:3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had
not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people
