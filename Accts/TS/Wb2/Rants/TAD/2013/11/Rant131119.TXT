Bill Gates is helping the poor.

What am I doing?

I can let him do that.  Not my business, I guess.

$FG,4$5:18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father,
making himself equal with God.

5:19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the
Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son
likewise.

5:20 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye
may marvel.

5:21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even
so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

5:22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son: 5:23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they
honour the Father.$FG$

Memory will fragment.

The stack does not grow.

RedSea filesystem files do not expand.

STDIN/STDOUT don't quite exist.  They are not serialized.

Those are the bad side of trade-offs.  Advantages were created to offset.

The CIA and Gates played dirty. SecureBoot.  God was my friend at the time and had contributed to the design... it's reasonable to conclude it's His temple.

God's official Temple, Ya fucken dickhead, how about that?  Greedy evil fucker.

This will not STAND!

What you do not grasp... no national security threat when the whole world changes-over to a God worshiping and God fearing world.

$FG,4$11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
Egyptians.

Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the
sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out
into the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of
Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his
throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the
mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.

11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD
doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.$FG$
