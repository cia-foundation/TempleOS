I added a song.  It's very difficult to make a song that doesn't sounds like one of my other songs.

BBC has geneticist who says the human Y chromozome is disappearing.  It sounded like when a journalist invokes Moore's Law.  I hate that.

There was a story on the lack of Suns spots... and no global warming.

My code is perfect.  I have changed anything not perfect ignoring backward compatibility.  That's the key.  So long as you do not keep blemished code on account of backward compatibility, it can be kept perfect.  There is no large thing that needs to be overhauled -- nothing needs a rewrite.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished code.)  

3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

I need to finalize RedSea and GRA, before you implement them.  (Minor changes.)

$WW,1$Paging is almost not used, but 64-bit mode requires it to be active.  Virtual is identity-mapped to physical.  All tasks on all cores use the same page table map, just as though all addresses are physical addresses.  2 Meg page table entries are used, except the first 2 Meg, which uses 4K page tables entries.  Nothing swaps to disk, either.

In TempleOS, the lowest 2 Gig of memory is called the "$FG,2$code heap$FG$".  TempleOS's compiler always uses 32-bit signed relative JMP & CALL instructions because 64-bit CALLs take two instructions.  With signed +/- 32-bit values, code can only call a function within 2 Gig distance.  Therefore, TempleOS keeps all code in the lowest 2 Gig memory addresses including what would normally be called "the kernel".  Two Gig is plenty, don't worry.

You can create new, independent heaps by first allocating mem with $LK,"MemBlksUncachedAlloc",A="MN:MemBlksUncachedAlloc"$() or $LK,"MemBlksIndependentAlloc",A="MN:MemBlksIndependentAlloc"$(), then calling $LK,"HeapCtrlBPInit",A="MN:HeapCtrlBPInit"$() and, then, using $LK,"MAlloc",A="MN:MAlloc"$().

Memory allocated by a task will be freed when the task is killed.

Eventually, memory will become fragmented, requiring a reboot.

See $LK,"MemRep",A="MN:MemRep"$().

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished code.)  

3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

My operating system is not a general purpose, "conventional" operating system like Linux and Windows.  I want those to stay as they are.  My operating system doesn't have to be "failure is not an option".  Guess what?  If failure is an option -- I don't have to support everything, like 6 monitor surround sound with tread-mill input devices -- If I can fail and say, "Won't do that..." Then, I can be an order of magnitude simpler from that alone.  I won't support bad disk blocks.  Get a new drive.  I won't try to not crash.  Just reboot like we did with DOS or a C64.  By allowing reboot as normal, that's another order of magnitude simpler.  I will just support common pre-PCI devices.  That's two more orders of magnitude saved.  From 50,000,000 we are down to 100,000 lines of code.  That's where were are.  And no networking.

The C64 worked fine.  You guys are talking like it would never fly.  Let's stop and think.  You have mental blocks -- brain washing -- that would make you say a C64 could never have worked and was useless.  How could you possibly use a C64 if it could crash and had all kinds of corner-case bugs?

I don't want to talk to a test engineer.  He doesn't get it.  Put it this way -- we have a budget of 100,000 lines of code.  If we cut corners, we can have more stuff.

I can't tell.  Did the assembler guy call me a liar?

I have a just-in-time HolyC compiler that can be invoked on assembler expressions.  If it hits an undefined label, it makes a new label with a spot for its value.  In the expression assembly code, it dereferences the spot that is going to have the label's address.  When the day of reconning comes, it does a quick check to see if all undefined labels have been met and it evaluates the chunk of x86_64 code for that expression.

It counts-up the number of absolute addresses in an expression.  If odd, then it makes an entry in the code-patch table used by the loader.  The loader will fix-up that location to hold an absolute address when loaded.

I mostly don't allow ORG.  You are supposed to let the loader place your code in a chunk that is MAlloced off of the code heap (lowest 2 Gig addresses).  The loader will patch it.

I recently added a MODULE_ORG.  Only one such is allowed.  You have no business using it.  It can be used to assemble instructions like a debugger injecting it in a certain spot in memory.

I normally get scoffers who immediately think I'm lying when I say I made an assembler and compiler.  I take great pleasure in telling them, "Just try to do 16-bit segmentation with my assembler!"  My assembler does not support 16-bit code very well.  You have to manually do segment related stuff.  I only need a little 16-bit code, so I did not make my assembler needlessly complex.  Users have no business writing 16 bit code.  2001 Space Odyssee "Dave what are you doing Dave writing 16 bit code?"

I thought Bill Gates was miserable, like when I was converted from atheism and thought I had to give-up computers.  He's not that holy, though, still doing shit to protect his company in scumball ways.

I have many ideas... maybe pathetic... I thought Gates might like to do a BASIC interpreter.  We give him a budget of, I donno, 4,000 lines of code and let him use all the JIT compiler infrastructure.  It's as prestigeous as Solomon's Temple.  I thought it was a beautiful idea.  I can understand if he says, "meh".

Grub is sabotage, intentional or not -- they confuse you into thinking a bootloader is big.  GCC confuses you into thinking a compiler is big.  I think Boch's is sabotauge.  Nobody at your site is 64-bit so it would probably be full of bugs for 64-bit code.  No thanks.  Use VMware -- most people have no problem with VMware.  It's a sure thing.  Sometimes there a grievers who will say, "Your code is not 64-bit.  I insist on running it on 32-bit hardware.  You lie.  It's real mode, not 64-bit."  For ten years, these people have said, "Your code is not 64-bit it's real mode." We don't get anywhere.
