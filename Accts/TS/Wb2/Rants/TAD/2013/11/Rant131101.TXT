Bill Gates getting cocky?  This operating system is God's Temple.  It's 64 bit and has better multicore than Windows.  I did a 8 core flightsimulator.  God said 640x480 16 color.  It's forever capped at 100,000 lines of code, more like a C64 ROM as the vision.  I wrote a compiler for $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$.

God draws...

It looks like an airport from the air.  No!  It's a C64 logo.

Let me explain why 640x480 16 color.  The Temple is where people do offerings and get responses.

Just imagine a kid.  If you give him 4-bit colors and He draws an elephant, it's better than 24-bit.  He will feel inadequate with 24-bit, trying to do cylinder  gradients and stuff.

God says...

1:13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's
meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.

1:14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.

1:15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and
fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the
king's meat.

1:16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
that they should drink; and gave them pulse.

1:17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in
all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions
and dreams.

My operating system is better for education.  My generation learned on C64s.

Don't fucken fight against God -- give-up.

God said this OS must be perfect.  We want to get rid of all blemishes thinking 1000 years.  We will break compatibility every time there is a blemish.  I want to get rid of FAT32 and even ISO9660 by having Windows&Linux support RedSea filesystem on HD and CDROM.

With 640x480 4-bit color, it is easier to achieve perfection than 24-bit 1900x1000.

I get lossless compression for free because 4-bit color compresses well with LZW.  I have LZW compression built-into my file system on files ending with .Z

I assume you are watching me.  You are not repeatedly downloading this file, though, according to my logs.  I could upload before consulting God, so you could verify the miracle.  You are not downloading this file, though.  Fuck that.
