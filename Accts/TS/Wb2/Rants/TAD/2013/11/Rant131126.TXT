I made a Tank wargame.  To me, it's as abstract and innocent as chess.  I'm laughing, listening to a story on the BBC about Unkrane siding with Russia or Europe.  It's like worrying about black/white race relations in games of chess.

14:7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will

14:8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock

bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.

14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,

decayeth and drieth up: 14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till

Some day, maybe, I'll hire somebody to fix the tank game.  That sounds like a nice job to have.

Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers,
and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their
fathers.

24:5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of
the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

Imagine you've been committed to a mental hospital.  They talk about you behind your back about your fate.

I got doctors or prison wardens, or some shit, in charge of my life.  There's a whole campaign of shit they don't tell me.  Somehow, I lost all my citizen rights and I must endure trials and tribulations.  They do web pages as psychological tests and shit.  They have actors who find me in stores and test if I'm a pedophile or deviant.

I just read Brendan proudly talking about his scheduler queues.  I use simple round-robin that doubles as window-z-order.

Brendan matter-of-factly talks about his fancy scheduler.  He seems to think my simple scheduler is simple because I couldn't make it complex.  Use a little psychology.  I wrote a compiler.  My scheduler is simple.  Is my scheduler simple becuase I'm not smart enough to make it complicated?

Let me explain my company name "Trivial Solutions".  Guess what makes my day?  Using things that are brilliantly simple.

My operating system in ring-0-only.
My operating system is identity-mapped.
My operating system has a round-robin scheduler on each core.

My operating system crashes on the slightest thing.  DOS and a C64 crashed on the slightest thing.  Back when we all used DOS, ask yourself... did we freak-out if it hung or crashed?  Back then, we just rebooted and a booted fast.

If you have a multiuser mainframe, crashing and rebooting is bad.

When writing code in Visual Studio, you frequently hang a process.  How long does it take to kill it and restart- 30 seconds?  Why is rebooting any worse if it boots fast?  It's not.  You're a snob.  You have a snobby issue with rebooting.  You're a clown/pussy.

I don't have a good debugger.  Once you reach multitasking multicore, you don't want to be debugging, LOL.

I have a 100,000 line of code limit.  It's at 83,100.  I got the start of a debugger written.  Maybe, one of you wants to improve it.  It does quite a bit -- it will let you step through code and it brings-up source files and finds the line numbers.  My window paint is done by the window manager task with a callback.  That fucks everythign up.  If you break-point the window manager paint callback, the screen freezes!  Fuck that.

That guy spoke of robust semicolon error reporting and fixing.   Legit, I guess.  If you want to look at my compiler, it's really simple.

Brendan spoke of errno.

Everything is a HolyC function -- commmand line calls are function calls with function returns.  They can be nestled as args to other function calls.  It's C/C++.

I have exceptions.  My language has exceptions.  I don't need ugly error reporting status as function return values because I just throw an exception on out-of-memory.

Mine is divine intellect, Heaven.  Others are shit.

Apple II could draw graphics from the command line in 3 lines.

thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown,
and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 25:25 And I was afraid, and
went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is
thine.

servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where
I have not strawed: 25:27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine
own with usury.

hath ten talents.

25:29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath.

25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
