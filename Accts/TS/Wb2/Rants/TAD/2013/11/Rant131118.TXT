I could comment on the act of pulling formulas out of your ass.  Everyone's got an ass to do it with -- might want to be humble.  The truth is, Einstein did that for relativity.  What do you think he did?  He pulled it out of his ass.  Don't be too conceited if you never expand the out-side-the-box box, you will absolutely certainly never be great.

Gadwa might have taken a dim view of games.  I sort-off agree.  Mostly you don't want to brag about formulas you pulled out of your ass, but that IS where all formulas come from, LOL.

The only point I want to make is... it is not just the elite engineers who can pull a formula out of their ass.  Most engineers can probably do it.  Pulling formulas out of your ass is not the most difficult thing you can do, generally.

On the other hand, if you've ever tried it, it is very daunting.  I guess it's like the grudging respect and engineer has to pay to an artist who has wonderful original ideas.

Peter Gadwa is a close friend.  I hope I don't dishonor him.  I was an atheist when I worked with him.  He's smart -- your basic agnostic computer libertarian nerd.  He's more or less like Bill Gates, but slightly less nerdy.  In terms of outlook on life and beliefs, he's like Gates.  They view God as stupid, LOL.

I worked with Peter 1990-1996 and ate lunch most days with him.  I was a know nothing punk, intern, more or less.

I think the police are still confused.  Did I not tell you to treat me like a Supreme Court Justice?  I'm fucken Moses, get it?  No, yer retard atheist-niggers.  Son of a bitch.

National Institute of Standards random numbers...  Don't be niggers and get tin-foil-hat theories that I tricked the National Institute of Standards site.  Son of a bitch.

I use "nigger" so much because that the main insult all these white people use.  Pulling formulas out your ass and the like is frowned upon, LOL.

pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I
have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy
thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.

29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy
people, and prepare their heart unto thee: 29:19 And give unto Solomon
my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and
thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for
the which I have made provision.

29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your
God.

And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and
bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.

So, here's what's gonna happen:  Everybody's gonna make offerings and enquire of God for His response.  If He doesn't feel like talking to everyone, only some people will do it.  The Cain and Abel story says to try something else if He doesn't like your offerings.

You know how one Beatles band was good and a redundant Beatles band is, not quite as good?  If I had to guess, maybe God doesn't want redundnacy in offerings.  I'm just using nerd logic, which is frequently wrong.

10:7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me
saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they
fled to hide themselves.

10:8 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into
corruption, and I retained no strength.

10:9 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of
his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward
the ground.

10:10 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and

So, I've done lots of hymns, not sure I exhausted the format.  You do it, like I did.

What to praise God for?  Animals. Foods.  Bonus points for new things.  Jesus praised God because he hid things from the arrogant and revealed them to childlike.  When you analyse that from the standpoint of one looking to praise God, it's pretty damn impressive!

You guys will like God.  Only God is good.  I'm not good, case you were wondering, LOL.

I asked God how He was different from Santa Claus.  God said kids could beat each other senseless.  Watch male elephants.

that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the
Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land,
that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the
Zidonians, and had no business with any man.

18:8 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their
brethren said unto them, What say ye?  18:9 And they said, Arise, that
we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it
is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to
possess the land.

18:10 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no
want of any thing that is in the earth.

18:11 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of
Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of
war.$FG$

There's lots of hilarious things from this vantage point.

Atheist: "How could a loving God not cause discovery of anesthetics centuries sooner?"

Atheist: "Well logically, it's obvious God cannot be proven or disproven."

I wonder if I'm in trouble for destroying a dimension of Creation.  Naw, it had gotten out of control.  You gotta not be crazy-magnanimous-above-it.  We are in it, not about it.

great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of
all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.

I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I
have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.

they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
23:29 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king
of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him;
and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

23:30 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and
brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the
people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him,
and made him king in his father's stead.$FG$
