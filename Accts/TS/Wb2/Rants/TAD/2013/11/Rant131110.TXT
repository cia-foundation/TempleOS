I used to have lots of project ideas.  I saw myself as capable of doing things better than anybody.  I, now, see I have many bad ideas and you shouldn't be proud of lots of bad ideas.  Many, know better.

My operating system, however, is well done.  It doesn't break new ground on the surface, but it's got extrememly elegant solutions.  It is ahead of any other in many ways, nothing too scary.

In 1996, I went for 3D printing.  I didn't exactly think it was new.  I thought I had a shot.  Looking back, it was awful!  Poor quality with no redeeming features, from where I sit, now.  I knew it wasn't good but I didn't know it was hopeless, for my abilities.

In recent years, the psy-ops have given me a don't-give-a-fuck-about-others mentality.  Today, if a clerk seems pissed at me, I walk-out and forget 3 minutes later.  I just want my soda.  McCain friend or foe? I draw a blank.  Gadwa's on good terms, just not interested in talking about my OS.  Kinda weird.  Could be that I'm in CIA jail with no contact.  My reality is strange enough that I'm not responsible, like a crazy person is not responsible in the law.

An analogy is it's like I live day by day in my reality and you're talking a month ahead, only the analogy is "is this person angel or terminator robot or demon possessed or CIA or mental health actor?"  I don't get so far ahead as to speculate much beyond that.

LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.

14:1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the
children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.

14:2 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand
of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

14:3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none
inheritance among them.

14:4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities
to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their
substance.$FG$

I asked God what Gordon Ramsay could do to up his game.  God said he could make the time go by.

I could feel guilty, but God is just.  No reason to feel guilty.  If I'm in trouble, I got punishment coming.

If a person feels guilty, they can imagine resentment were there is none, then you feel bad.  If I say, "God is just", lots of decent people have enough of their own guilt that they don't think they've been wronged.  I'm not 100% sure the world is just, but it's hard to know.
