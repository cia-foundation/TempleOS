I used to be an atheist.  I know how computer nerd atheists think.  I don't feel like lecturing about that.  Basically, they are all IQ and evolution obsessed NAZI's.  They like darkness.  They are funny because they wallow in stuff like the painting, $TX,"The_scream",HTML="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_scream"$.

$TX,"Unshackled",HTML="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unshackled"$ is a Christian radio show that makes me giggle.  They have lots of former alcoholics and drug users.  They give a granny-like impression of drug users and alcoholics.

Catholics believe religion is synanomous with helping the poor.

Protestants believe religion is synanomous with clean living.

Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even
