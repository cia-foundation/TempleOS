God said, "Pride or Money, choose one."

Once you know the world is perfectly just, you can "hack" it.  If you give-up some reward you are due, you get compensated with something else.

"A pearl that you sell all for."  "A treasure in a field."  God's wit can be reward.  Perhaps, being inspired as a Muse when late in life, beyond the age...

Don't worry -- God can vouch that I made everything in the operating system except a few pix art pieces, nothing in the songs did He contribute to.

Isn't that nice that we can relax and not worry about getting ripped-off?  Turn the other cheek and laugh if someone rips-you-off.  Don't you get it, now, the Christian "turn the other cheek."  It's obvious, once you know the World is perfectly just.

thy glory.

2:17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the
violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

2:18 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of
his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?  2:19 Woe unto him that

at all in the midst of it.

2:20 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep
silence before him.
