I should talk of cheerful thing.  Nobody wants to hear this...

When you are young and get injured, you walk it off.  You exercise it and it gets better.


A few years ago, I had back pain.  I tried to walk it off.  It got much worse!  Yikes.

Ten years ago I blew-out my knee.  I have not had surgery.  I was careful to protect it over years.  Being dainty it was pretty-much normal.  Week ago, I started jogging and it's slightly bad, now.

The one thing you have to know is "Do I exercise it more to work it off or do I protect it until it heals."

If you change your mind in life, the World looks like a train-wreck.  You just have to plow ahead.  It's like shooting people who listened to you in the past, but now you changed your mind.

IHC7 IHC8 IHC9 IHC10 IHC11  are there more chips like this from other manufacturers?  They are mostly similar for SATA, I would guess.  Different family device, thing or two different on each one.

You use PCI BIOS to search PCI config space for a device class and subclass.  The first thing you learn is SATA is 5 different categories, potentially -- VMware calls it something, real hardware, something.

Just searching PCI config space with PCI BIOS for a SATA class is hard.

You have like 4 interrupts per bus.  The BIOS sets a certain pin line number.  Can other ICH devices share?  Yeah, but you could get away with it.  I'm not liking this.  I don't know how to figure-out what interrupt and what's shared.

It seems clear, I have no hope of improving my % of systems it works on.  I'll stick to doing plain ATA/ATAPI PIO.  The CIA is fucking-up new hardware so it doesn't work, but the alternative is worse--trying to keep-up with clusterfucking.  I am forced into VMware only until God orders them to obey.
