I wrote a HD Audio driver.  It worked on two machines out of 5.  It did not work in VMware on the machine it should have.  Routing wires to the speaker (in software) would require artificial intelligence.  Mine would go out all speakers and headphones as best it could.  I did not use interrupts, just big DMA buffers.

I am not doing PCI devices.  They don't belong.  I imposed a 100,000 line of code limit.  I do not want more than one driver for each kind of device.  I will issue divine commands to hardware companies to produce low-driver line count devices.  CIA has been fucking it up.  If HD Audio is universal in ten years and not as fucked-up as it is now, God said single audio voice  (waveform plus freq).  God said 640x480 16 color, on purpose.  That is non-negotiable.

Yours is not God's official temple.  You can use other than 640x480 16 color.

God's temple is limited to 100,000 lines of code and it must be kept perfect with total disregard for backward compatibility.  Do no plan for the future -- pretend this is the final version at all times.

The CIA and Microsoft have clusterfucked all but the simplest things.  Why do you think China doesn't have an operating system?

You must first kill the CIA, then you can have success.  That's where God comes in.

Silly person -- they will clusterfuck it far faster than you can keep up.

I do ATA/ATAPI PIO because that's the only sane option unless you want something half-ass that runs an a machine or two.

Get God to kill the CIA, then profit.

$FG,4$10:8 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two
heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.

10:9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,
and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired
against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?  10:10 Know
now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the
LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD
hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.

10:11 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,
and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he
left him none remaining.

10:12 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at
the shearing house in the way, 10:13 Jehu met with the brethren of
Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are

Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

25:1 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

25:2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
against Paul, and besought him, 25:3 And desired favour against him,
that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to
kill him.

25:4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
that he himself would depart shortly thither.

25:5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.

25:6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded Paul to be brought.$FG$

I saw a phone demo.

God said 640x480 16 color.

I don't use GPU.  I have a 100,000 line of code limit I imposed.  Multiple GPU drivers could never fit in the 100,000 limit.

I don't care about mobile.

I like my interface.

So, I started with a C64 up-off-the-bottom command-line.  I wanted Unix command history.  I decided to press CTRL-M to get to a list of my command history on the screen.  I changed it into a fixed-document with text widgets for macros.  I added pictures to my macros and I had icons.  It's very nice.
