And, there are polar dust particles -- iron or something -- maybe like iron filings under a magnet.  (I said that knowing it might be nonsense.)

God looks for a good heart.  King David was a man after God's heart.  David volunteered to fight Goliath, "Let me kill this heathen who insults God!  I killed a bear with my own hands."  King David liked women.  King David was a warrior.

Don't be proud of heart.  Catholic: "Oh, I don't like Air Craft carriers, cause Africans are starving and it's a weapon."  Left Liberal: "Military industrial complex screwing the poor."

Just neat shit.  Greek play said a man can be reveal in a harem by putting arms on one table and decorations on another table.

It's a little childish.

I give 10% tithe.  My logic is give 10% no matter how much or how little you have.  If you haved a lot, make jobs.  I even made-up for my atheist non-giving phase.  It's kinda embarassing admitting that when I was an atheist, I was not, in fact, a good person, LOL -- you kinda think you are, of course.

I'm really mean and take pleasure in charities that not always include the poor.  I give to NPR, sometimes.  I have given to a preacher, Chuck Swindol.  He's good.  I don't give to the Catholic Church.  It's like a Jew who really eagerly tells you how much he loves pork.  It's funny because I don't like pork, especially, myself, oddly, but bacon.  I'll eat ham.  The texture is not my favorite.

In theory, I'd like to give to zoos, since they cause praise of God, but haven't yet.  (I like to annoy liberals since the animals are captive -- ever since Dad worked for nuclear power, I have been anti-liberal.)   Telescopes cause praise.  They are really really neat.  I would enjoy working on telescopes.

You know what?  We're not going to get any more fabulous new pictures from telescopes.  I'm pretty sure, that's how it works -- we gotten just about all we will get by way of fabulous pictures.

God has not begged for zoos.  I thought He was delighted at all the kids seeing His magnificient animals.  God doesn't like my drumming and God doesn't care about zoos.  He once commented on animal cruelty, I think.  He tells me not to be cruel to the dog.

Growing-up I was Catholic and was told immigration was a sad situation and some people in the church broke the law.

Recently, God said no more immigration.  I had an ephiphany -- there is nothing evil with no-immigration.  God very carefully gives birthrights.  He decides how smart, how handsome, how talented, how rich, what country, what race, what species.

The biggest grievance in the world exists because the evil injustice of the Catholic church overspreading unfairly their genes.  Of course people are pissed-off.  God is slightly pissed about some having too few babies, but all can be resolved peacefully with a simple no-immigration policy.

If God thinks no-immigration is okay, who can possibly raise arguement?

On the Arab Jew conflict, God said "Oil funny, hopefully".  God loved Jacob and hated Esau.  Esau gave-up his birthright.  God's favorite saint is Santa.  God wants to be the hero.  His big job is handing-out birthrights.  That's the main thing He does.
