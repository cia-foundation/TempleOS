$FG,2$To a Waterfowl;
by William Cullen Bryant
 
Whither, 'midst falling dew,
While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
Thy solitary way?

Vainly the fowler's eye
Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,
Thy figure floats along.

Seek'st thou the plashy brink
Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
On the chafed ocean side?

There is a Power whose care
Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,--
The desert and illimitable air,--
Lone wandering, but not lost.

All day thy wings have fann'd
At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere:
Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
Though the dark night is near.

And soon that toil shall end,
Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,
And scream among thy fellows; reed shall bend
Soon o'er thy sheltered nest.

Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven
Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
And shall not soon depart.

He, who, from zone to zone,
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
In the long way that I must tread alone,
Will lead my steps aright.

Yeah, I like the idea of improving song lyrics.  I think we will have so many, they will require a rating of 9.9 to be placed on the distribution.  :-)  Currently, I distribute my songs from rating 7 to 9 and keep inferior 0-6 ones private.  I purged them all, one time.  Now, I just immediately trash bad new songs.  Quality is everything and quantity is nothing, except if it's sentimental to you.

Mostly just enjoy God's company and get to know Him.  If you feel strongly about something He says, obey.

Highs and lows balance.  Sin gets punished and it's usually fun.  Virtue gets rewarded.  I think you should assume that nothing can change justice.  Just forget about sin when talking with God.

You should love and praise and get to know the person of God and leave sin and justice outside the relationship.

Most people are just very afraid of Hell.  If there were no salvation, how many people would take the time to know and talk with and praise God?

$FG,4$49:19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan
against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run
away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?
for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
shepherd that will stand before me?  49:20 Therefore hear the counsel
of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that
he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of
the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations
desolate with them.

49:21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the
noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.

49:22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his
wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men
of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

49:23 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they
have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the
sea; it cannot be quiet.$FG$

TempleOS is nonnetworked.  It has a document format that supports active links (to local files) and trees and colors and many more things including sprites.

The commands start and end with '$$'.  They have a two character command-type code, some flags, and one or two data items depending on the flags and type.  Usually, one.  Rarely, two.  Possibly, three.

The point is, it is different from XML's requirements, possibly.

Sometimes, I, literally, am divinely inspired.  My work is divine intellect.  Seriously.

The HTML flags is very rare, only for me.  I like to publish my files to my website, so I made a conversion for native document to HTML format.  Sometimes, I want a word to be an HTML link.  So, I do this crazy thing of defining a flag in my native document just for data in case it is converted to HTML at some point.  

Most people have at most two data items on a command.  Yes the order is impossible to remember, but you have wizards <CTRL-L> that will assist you, so you don't need to remember.

I guess we're okay, but I'm slightly less joyful thinking mine is ugly.

Life is a journey, not a destination.  Spending quality time with God... that's the best thing you can do, unless you don't please Him or something.  He likes soap operas and does not pay attention to young men.

What's Putin up to?  I think he believes in God and is pious... I could be wrong.  I kinda like him.

Somebody told a story about a trip to Russia where they were friends with gangstirs.  It was wonderful being a VIP doing outrageous stuff.  The little people suffered and it was not wonderful for them, though.  In other words, corruption is great if you're a beneficiary.

Just pray you never have complicated moral questions, like loyalty and stuff like that.

$FG,4$2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,

them in derision.

sore displeasure.

My old bird squawks when he wants me to help him get from the perch to the cage.  He keeps squawking until I get him.  The dog pretends to be my friend but just wants to kill the birds.  When the bird is in the cage, it is low enough for the dog to bother it.

The fucken bird was squawking nonstop for me to bring it down to the cage.   The fucken dog sits in my lap staring at the birds and leaps-out.  I smack the dog for nearly getting the bird.  The fucken birds go spastic and fly all over and end-up on the ground where the dog can get them.  At this point I am furious at my fucken bird for landing on the ground.

$FG,4$4:12 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
departed into Galilee; 4:13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in
Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and
Nephthalim: 4:14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias
the prophet, saying, 4:15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of
Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the
Gentiles; 4:16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and
to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
up.

4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand.

4:18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon
called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for
they were fishers.

4:19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
men.$FG$
