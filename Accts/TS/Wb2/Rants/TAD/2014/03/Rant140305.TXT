That might help.  I'm not doing a UEFI version.

I should do a schema, I guess, for my "Dollar sign" documents and HolyC.  Backus Naur Form?

How about a name for "Dollar Sign" documents, LOL.  They don't teach that.  It took a really long time before I figured-out I needed a name for HolyC and the RedSea file system.  Now I need a name for my documents.

How about "Honey Drop" or "Honey Doc"?

$FG,2$10:10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it
up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten
it, my belly was bitter.$FG$

$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Dollar Sign Cmds"$$FG$

TempleOS supports rich-text type cmds which are bracketed with '$$'.  Use $FG,2$<CTRL-L>$FG$ to experiment with them.  Use $FG,2$<CTRL-T>$FG$ to toggle between plain text and rich text.

The format of '$$' cmds includes a two character code, +/-flags, a comma and args separated by commas.  The flags often determine how many and what args the cmd takes.  A $LK,"color define",A="MN:BLACK"$ bracked by '$$'s, will change the foreground color.

See $LK,"::/Doc/Widget.TXT"$ and $LK,"::/Demo/Doc/DemoDoc.TXT"$.

See $LK,"Doc Type Defines",A="MN:DOCT_TEXT"$ and $LK,"Doc Type Codes",A="FF:::/Adam/Doc/DocInit.CPP,ST_DOC_CMDS"$
$TR-C,"TX Text"$
$ID,2$Normally, text is not bracketed with "$$", but if you wish to specify flag attr to center text, you can bracket them with "$$" and enter flags such as "$FG,4$+CX$FG$".  You can't edit them if they are bracketed by "$$" unless you toggle to plain text mode with <CTRL-T>.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"CR Hard Carriage Return (New Line)"$
$ID,2$Carriage returns are normally specified without being bracketed with "$$".
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"SR Soft Carriage Return (New Line)"$
$ID,2$Word wrap uses soft carriage returns which are not saved.  You never place soft carriage returns by yourself.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"TB Tab"$
$ID,2$Tabs are normally not bracketed with "$$", but are stored as ASCII#9.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"CU Cursor pos"$
$ID,2$The cursor pos is usually stored as a ASCII#5 character and is not bracketed with "$$".  You do not normally enter cursor pos cmds yourself.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"ID Indent +/- num"$
$ID,2$This changes the indention deeper if positive or shallower if negative. It effects the behavior of trees.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"DA Data"$
$ID,2$primarily used for forms that prompt for data. Use $FG,2$<CTRL-L>$FG$ as a resource editor-type thing to generate the text you'll need in your "$FG,2$fmtstr$FG$" cmd in a $FG,2$class$FG$.  If you add it directly with $LK,"DocPrint",A="MN:DocPrint"$(), you'll need to fill-in the data addr.  See $LK,"DocFormDo",A="MN:DocFormDo"$(),$LK,"::/Demo/Doc/Form.CPP"$.

If there is a ':', the space after the first ':' in the format string marks the first valid cursor pos.
  
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"Text Colors"$
$ID,2$You place an expression(usually a color define--see $LK,"color defines",A="MN:BLACK"$) to indicate which of the 16 colors to use. If you enter no num, color returns to the default.
$FG,5$FD$FG$ Default Foreground Color
$FG,5$BD$FG$ Default Background Color
$FG,5$FG$FG$ Foreground Color
$FG,5$BG$FG$ Background Color
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"CL clear"$
$ID,2$Clear all previous entries except ones with hold($FG,4$+H$FG$) flags.  You might want $FG,4$+H$FG$ on word wrap entries.  Alternatively, you can use $LK,"DocClear",A="MN:DocClear"$().
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"PT User Prompt"$
$ID,2$Start of a user prompt.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"WW Word Wrap"$
$ID,2$Include a 1 or 0.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"HL Highlighting"$
$ID,2$Include a 1 or 0.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"UL Underline"$

$ID,-2$$TR-C,"BK Blink"$
$ID,2$Include a 1 or 0.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"SX Shift X pos"$
$ID,2$* Include a num from -7 to 7.
* Only foreground is shifted.
* Positive right.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"SY Shift Y pos"$
$ID,2$* Include a num from -7 to 7.
* Only foreground is shifted.
* Positive down.

$ID,-2$$TR-C,"AN Anchor"$
$ID,2$
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"LK Link"$
$ID,2$By default, links have a separate tag text from link text, but with the $FG,4$-A$FG$ flag you can make the link displayed as in example 3.

$ID,2$See $LK,"::/Demo/Doc/MenuButton.CPP"$.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"CB Check Box"$
$ID,2$
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"MA Macro"$
$ID,2$Macro's are usually placed into menu/help areas and they have the '$FG,4$+X$FG$' flag set by default.  Adding '$FG,4$-X$FG$' prevents the usual $FG,2$<ESC>$FG$ from being sent (which exits the macro screen).  Note that when you output a macro to the cmd line, when the user clicks on it, it will go to the bottom and execute it unless you cancel the $FG,2$<ESC>$FG$ with a '$FG,4$-X$FG$'.

$ID,-2$$TR-C,"MU Menu Value"$
$ID,2$See $LK,"PopUpRangeI64",A="MN:PopUpRangeI64"$().
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"HX Hex Edit"$
$ID,2$See $LK,"DocD",A="MN:DocD"$().
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"TR Tree Widget"$
$ID,2$A tree widget is a branch in a collapsable tree.  The domain of the branch extends from the first +indent until enough -indents bring it back to where it started.  Tree's begin collapsed unless a $FG,4$-C$FG$ flag is present.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"SP Sprite"$
$ID,2$You can insert a sprite into text with $FG,2$<CTRL-R>$FG$.  It is critical where the cursor is at the time you enter $FG,2$<CTRL-R>$FG$ because the sprite will be offset from that location.  This is especially important when adding images to programs.  Numbers for sprites are automatically chosen because copying to and from the clipboard requires this.  You can insert another sprite with the same image by hitting $FG,2$<CTRL-T>$FG$ and manually adding a $FG,4$$$SP$$$FG$ entry with the same num.  You can cause the $FG,4$$$SP$$$FG$ cmd to appear with some text associated with it by manually adding text into the $FG,4$$$SP$$$FG$ cmd, as in $FG,4$$$SP,"pic 2",2$$$FG$.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"IB Insert Binary"$
$ID,2$This cmd is used to tell the compiler to fetch the binary data stored after the end of text.  There is basically one type of binary data in DOC's at this point--sprites-- created with $FG,2$<CTRL-R>$FG$. They have a number associated with them.  This number is automatically chosen, because copying to the clip-board and back requires renuming. To use a $FG,4$$$IB$$$FG$ cmd, toggle to plain text ($FG,2$<CTRL-T>$FG$) after inserting a sprite and check the number in the $FG,4$$$SP$$$FG$ cmd. Create a $FG,4$$$IB$$$FG$ cmd with the same number and the sprite will be inserted into the compiled stream like a string const.  You can optionally include tag text to be displayed for the $FG,4$$$IB$$$FG$ cmd.

The main reason for the $FG,4$$$IB$$$FG$ cmd at this point is to pass a arg to the $LK,"Sprite3",A="MN:Sprite3"$() function.  See $LK,"::/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP"$.

$ID,-2$$TR-C,"IS Insert Binary Size"$
$ID,2$See $FG,4$$$IB$$$FG$.  This cmd inserts a number into the compiled stream describing the size of binary data associated with a number.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"HC html"$
$ID,2$The $LK,"ToHtml",A="MN:ToHtml"$() or $LK,"Doc2Html",A="MN:Doc2Html"$() routines will generate a html version of a document.  You can cause html code to be injected with $FG,5$HC$FG$.  Use the $FG,4$+HTML$FG$ flag to inject a html link.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"ER Error"$
$ID,2$When errors are detected in dollar cmds, an $FG,5$ER$FG$ entry is generated to hold the garbage so it is not lost.
$ID,-2$
See $LK,"Doc Flag Defines",A="MN:DOCEf1_TAG"$ and $LK,"Doc Flag Codes",A="FF:::/Adam/Doc/DocInit.CPP,ST_DOC_FLAGS"$
See $LK,"dft_flags",A="FF:::/Adam/Doc/DocPlain.CPP,doc_dft_flags1"$.
$TR-C,"FLAGS"$
$ID,2$$TR-C,"+H Hold"$
$ID,2$Tells it to not delete it when cleared with $FG,5$CL$FG$ or when the doc->max_entries is exceeded.  Word wrap is a good one to hold.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+A Auxilliary Str"$
$ID,2$Some cmds need other strs.  A $FG,4$+A$FG$ means an auxiliary str is present.  Links have $FG,4$+A$FG$ by default, so use a $FG,4$-A$FG$ if you wish the tag str and the link str to be the same.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+D Define Str"$
$ID,2$A $FG,4$+D$FG$ means a define str is present.  The tag will be regenerated by substituting the value of a system $FG,2$#define$FG$ or $LK,"DefineLoad",A="MN:DefineLoad"$() string.  See $LK,"::/Demo/Doc/DefineStr.CPP"$.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+TR Tree"$
$ID,2$* Make a tree branch.  Usually, this is placed on a text($FG,5$TX$FG$) entry.  The tree extends from the start until another tree entry or when indentation has been expanded and reduced back to the starting value.
* A $FG,4$+C$FG$ flag on a tree will start it collapsed.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+PU PopUp"$
$ID,2$A PopUp flag on a macro ($FG,5$MA$FG$) will cause the cmds to run in a new task, a pop-up window.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+C Collapsed"$
$ID,2$A collapsed flag on a tree $FG,5$TR$FG$ entry will cause it to start collapsed.  A $FG,4$-C$FG$ flag will make it start open.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+X <ESC> (Exit)"$
$ID,2$* A exit flag will cause a macro to send an $FG,2$<ESC>$FG$ before running(to exit the personal menu screen and return to the cmd prompt).  Actually, the default has an exit flag set so you might add a $FG,4$-X$FG$ to turn-off $FG,2$ESC$FG$.
* If an entry is already at the cmd prompt, the $FG,4$+X$FG$ will cause a movement to the bottom of the window.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+Q <SHIFT-ESC> (Abort Quit)"$
$ID,2$A quit flag is similar to a $FG,4$+X$FG$ except a $FG,2$<SHIFT-ESC>$FG$ instead of an $FG,2$<ESC>$FG$ to exit.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+Z Zero"$
$ID,2$A zero flag on a hex edit($FG,5$HX$FG$) entry will cause the offset from zero.  A $FG,4$-X$FG$ will show the actual memory addr. By default, $FG,5$HX$FG$ has the zero flag set.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+HTML"$
$ID,2$The $LK,"ToHtml",A="MN:ToHtml"$() or $LK,"Doc2Html",A="MN:Doc2Html"$() routines will generate a html version of a document.  You can cause html link on an item with $FG,4$+HTML$FG$.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+BP"$
$ID,2$The Bin Ptr Link flags lets you specify a filename and bin num to import a bin$FG$.  $FG,2$$$SP+BP,"<tag>",1,"filename,1"$$$FG$ will import bin num "1" from filename.
$ID,-2$$TR-C,"+RD Refresh Data"$
$ID,2$The Refresh Data flag on a $FG,5$DA$FG$ or a $FG,5$CB$FG$ makes the value updated continuously.
$ID,-2$$ID,-2$
$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Text-Widget Help"$$FG$

See $LK,"::/Doc/Dollar.TXT"$ for details on dollar sign cmds.

$FG,2$"Expression"$FG$ a num or HolyC algebraic term with operators and HolyC syms can be entered.
$FG,2$"Macro"$FG$ Most entries can behave like macro entries if you assign them macro strs.
$FG,2$"AutoStr"$FG$ Like a macro except it is an $LK,"AutoFile",A="FF:::/Doc/Glossary.TXT,AutoFile"$.  You can't have both an autostr and macro text defined.  

$FG,5$Tag Text$FG$ is the text that will be displayed for the item.  For links, you can leave it blank and the details of the link will be shown.
$FG,5$Hide$FG$ means display nothing, making an entry invisible.

$FG,5$Left X$FG$ relative to the left margin.
$FG,5$Center X$FG$ relative to the horizontal center of the window.
$FG,5$Right X$FG$ relative to the right margin.
$FG,5$Top Y$FG$ relative to the top of the window.
$FG,5$Center Y$FG$ relative to the vertical center of the window.
$FG$$FG,5$Bottom Y$FG$ relative to the bottom of the window.

$FG,5$Blink$FG$ make the text blink.
$FG,5$Invert$FG$ make the text inverted.
$FG,5$Underline$FG$ make the text underlined. 

$FG,5$Scroll X Length Expression$FG$ if a value is entered, the text will scroll in an area of this width.
$FG,5$Y Offset Expression$FG$ if a value is entered, the text will be shifted vertically by this many pixs, so you can make superscripts or subscripts.
$FG,5$X Offset Expression$FG$ if a value is entered, the text will be shifted horizontally by this many pixs.

$FG,5$Tree$FG$ The item will behave like a tree widget, with this as the root.
$FG,5$Collapsed$FG$ The tree or hidden widget will begin collapsed.
$FG,5$Define Str$FG$ will substitute a $FG,2$#define$FG$ or $LK,"DefineLoad",A="MN:DefineLoad"$() string for the tag.

$FG,5$Quote$FG$ Make the result suitable for including in a program, in quotes, especially $FG,4$fmtstr$FG$ entries in class definitions.

$FG,5$X Expression$FG$ For cursor movements, the horizontal value.
$FG,5$Y Expression$FG$ For cursor movements, the vertical value.

$FG,5$$BK,1$PopUp$BK,0$$FG$ For macro's, run the macro in a PopUp window.  Do this when making a macro to run a program, so it doesn't tie-up memory.

$FG,5$Escape$FG$ For macro's, send an $FG,2$<ESC>$FG$ char to exit before running the macro.  Without this, the macro runs in the wrong window, usually.

$FG,5$Refresh Data$FG$  updates $FG,4$$$DA$$$FG$ entry continuously.

$FG,5$Html Link$FG$  stores a link which will be embedded if you generate a html version of a document with $LK,"ToHtml",A="MN:ToHtml"$() or $LK,"Doc2Html",A="MN:Doc2Html"$().

$FG,4$all the earth.

57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are
fallen themselves. Selah.

57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
praise.

57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
early.

57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
thee among the nations.

57:10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the
clouds.

57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
above all the earth.$FG$

I am not messing with branch prediction.  It has enough horsepower to do 640x480 16 color.  I have written 20 games that run it through its intended usage.  It is satisfactory.  

If there were a no brainer branch prediction?  Maybe.  Loop unrolling would help, but I don't like that.

When you get religion, maybe, you'll be suggesting I remove features.  Cursor Movement in the document causes me to have to refresh the whole document, however tiny documents are the norm... but I can't deny the Bible.

When does this seige end?  It's not amusing.

I have a tank game.  It's stupid.  It's very bland.  You want a game where you think of lots of clever tricks.  The Perfect General was nice.

I've lost interest in games, largely.

Ukraine was probably where lots of WWII tank battles happened.

What if You drove a tank, God?

$TX,"KingJamesBible",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/files/BIBLE.TXT"$ (Jeremiah 24:1) God says...
$FG,4$Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of
Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from
Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.

24:2 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first
ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be
eaten, they were so bad.

24:3 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that
cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

24:4 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:5 Thus saith
the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I
acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have
sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.

24:6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring
them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them
down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.$FG$
