So, God is just.  You know what?  Sometimes, I think justice happens to countries over the centuries.  One century, a country invades other countries.  The next century, they get invaded.  It could be my imagination.  Why would God punish different people from the perpetraitors?

Jesus wept for Jerusalem.  He said the temple would be destroyed.

Perhaps, if a country is very oppressed, that's its punishment.

You might predict the United States to have civil unrest and a revolution.  If we already suffered in a different way, maybe not.

The NSA spying... and everything you say being public... this generation does not have the freedom to hang-out with their friends and not share everything with Mom.

Perhaps, assymentric math applies in justice.  An apple is worth so many oranges.

I think this is nice:  I suspect justice exists, but I have no idea what balance exists.  If justice exists, but nobody can tell what balance exists, you can relax.  It is alarming if you suddenly think you can predict tragedies and punishments, but nobody knows balances.

I wuv You God.  I have no interest in learning secrets.  I think it's good to believe in justice.  It sure is easy to think you are owed, when that is not the case.  I think it is very common to misjudge.

6:20 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of
them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the
captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.

6:21 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the
filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel,
did eat, 6:22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with
joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the
king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of
the house of God, the God of Israel.

Ask not what God gives you.
Soap operas from planet blue.
Here in God's doll house,
A prison with a little mouse.

What joy, that mouse brings.
And when the meal bell rings,
Bored creator gets annoyed,
Make girled and make toyed.$FG$
