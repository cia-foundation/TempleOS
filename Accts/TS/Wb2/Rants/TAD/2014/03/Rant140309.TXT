Do You like "To a Waterfowl", God?

$FG,2$To a Waterfowl;
by William Cullen Bryant

Whither, 'midst falling dew,
While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
Thy solitary way?

Vainly the fowler's eye
Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,
Thy figure floats along.

Seek'st thou the plashy brink
Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
On the chafed ocean side?

There is a Power whose care
Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,--
The desert and illimitable air,--
Lone wandering, but not lost.

All day thy wings have fann'd
At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere:
Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
Though the dark night is near.

And soon that toil shall end,
Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,
And scream among thy fellows; reed shall bend
Soon o'er thy sheltered nest.

Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven
Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
And shall not soon depart.

He, who, from zone to zone,
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
In the long way that I must tread alone,
Will lead my steps aright.
$FG$

My first lesson in PC hardware:  I did an ATA PIO driver.  I learned my drive or controller would not do READ, just MULTI_READ.  Yer kidding me!  Now, I do MULTI_READ and pray nobody want just READ.  I write one block at a time, I think, I don't remember.  Doing just one block is the safest.  The kids will probably do the max their controller will handle.  They are completely clueless that a different computer probably will not work.  They will be really cocky, too.  They like to brag about their graphics.  What good is one GPU driver, that probably only works for that particular GPU under special circumstances?

There's all kinds of crazy shit.  The CDROM boot will read up to 4 CDROM blocks on ... a computer I had.  Otherwise, I might have done a 2 (3) stage loader instead of 3 (4).  My bootloader is in a block.  It loads my 200K kernel which loads the rest.  If the CDROM boot block count was better, I could have loaded my 200K kernel right away, instead of making a boot block loader.

Basically, PC hardware is clusterfucked and the fewer assumptions you make the better.

"Hey God, what do You think of abortion?"

That is too direct.  You could get an answer if you did an offering, first.  His answers are frustratingly schroidingerish, or something,   Yes and No at the same time.  We don't have the luxury of simple logic.  Of course not, LOL.

If you ask a simple question, like abortion.  If you got a simple answer, what would you expect?  It would be a let-down when you get an ordinary answer to a question that only has ordinary answers.  What do you expect -- the answer exists and it is something.  The statement of an answer, looks pathetic when it is ordinary.  A manifest answer is a let-down compared to an imprecise eager imagination.  (I have learned to be more verbal.  God said Mom thought my spirituality was "visciously inferior".  I just combined "eager imagination".  Before, I combined "Jews are cornered animals who are hideously viscious.")
