An address is an address is an address.  There is one map.  Each task is not on a different map.  It is easy to convert an address to a symbol.  My wallpaper shows a stack trace for all tasks running.

Techically, you need a different symbol table for each task with the majority of symbols being in Adam's symbol table.  Almost all symbols are in Adam's table.  Adam is the father of all tasks and it looks in parent's symbol tables if not found.

Do not over engineer.  Scale both up AND down.  Shorter names on small projects and global variables are the right answer.  Mine is limited to 100,000 lines of code forever.

The problem is nobody has a sense of overengineering.  In computer science, it is impossible to overengineer.  In fact, the more flexible and farther ahead you plan, the more they praise you.

I put a limit of 2 Gigs on code, separated from data.  I am white, you are a nigger.  It's as simple as that.  A nigger thinks the brain can predict a 400Mhz clock when you press a key because a nigger does not know what a Mhz is.  A nigger sues McDonalds for a trillion dollars because a nigger does not know numbers.  2 Gig is enough for code.

I was irked by Linux greedy claims, so I kept ATA definitions to make a point.  Linux did not write the ATA spec.  It is not their property.  Did they put some added intelligence into the numbers and protocol to do ATA hard drive usage?  The actual intelligence is intellectual property of the ATA organization, not Linux.  Linux contributed no intellect.  I got the fucken ATA spec by looking at Linux code.  Then I got it for real.  I got HTML understanding from a program on-line.
