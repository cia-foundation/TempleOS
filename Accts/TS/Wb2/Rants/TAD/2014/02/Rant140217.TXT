A manned space mission is an order of magnitude more code.

We cut an order of magnitude by allowing crashes.  The included applications (games) and hymns represent the entire usage this is designed for.  During the 1980's, home users enjoyed C64's while NASA worked on VAXes or something.  In recent times, everybody has switched to mainframe capable operating systems.

We cut an order of magnitude by not covering all usage cases.  Whole files are loaded and saved, files are stored contiguously and do not grow.  You can do raw block access, if you like.

This is a kayak, not a titanic.  We don't want bugs, but we're not worried about somebody deleting a directory while another task is inside it.

Other operating systems bend-over-backward to optimize for playing two video games at once.

Today, I discovered my GodDoodle has a problem when some window with the "ON_TOP" flag is maximized and covering the whole fucken screen.  Gets ridiculous.
