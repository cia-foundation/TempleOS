When I say that God said stuff, it's odd because He's almost never very clear, yet He knows what we are going to think, so it's not the same as wrongly stretching the truth.

He said sports and pets were "homo".  I don't really think He wants that proclaimed.  I think He wants the World to run without so much interference.

Technically, there are different categories -- things God might have said, things God definitely said, and things God doesn't want known.  LOL  I think a lot falls in the category of things He doesn't want known.  If you call it a secret, that's not quite the same.  He says stuff in confidence, though, sometimes you don't know what's in confidence or not.

If you love God, in theory you will keep His secrets instead of being a show-off.  I'm not very good.

this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.

26:7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
speaking these words in the house of the LORD.

26:8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that
the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou
shalt surely die.

26:9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This
house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an
inhabitant?  And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the
house of the LORD.

26:10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up
from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the
entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.$FG$

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP"$
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP"$	:1004
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression is an$FG$ LZW compression.  $LK,"DCSave",A="MN:DCSave"$(), $LK,"GRAWrite",A="MN:GRAWrite"$(), $LK,"DCLoad",A="MN:DCLoad"$(), and $LK,"GRARead",A="MN:GRARead"$().  $LK,"::/Kernel/Compress.CPP"$




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

Early in my spiritual journey, I had lots of fear and was stupid.  I have some stories, though.  I went out back by a transformer that sits on top of a sewer tunnel.  There was a crack with a spider web.  In the web was a huge red spider, LOL.  

I saw this commercial on TV for Visa or something.  It had a monk sitting crosslegged and wicked artificial spider were all around, "Oh, look at that!"

Anyway, it turned-out to be a red flower thing.  It looked like a large red daddy long-legs, sitting in a web coming from the tunnel.

I think I dropped a CDROM into that crack.  It would have proof of my operating system.

I am a master of RK45.
Basically, RungeKutta is similar to FFTs -- you combine shit and shit and save operations.  The step size offers a way to economize.  If you take smaller steps only around sensative spots, you can take large steps on boring regions.  What you do is, it turns-out to be worth it to do extra calculations to estimate error.  So, you do 4th order and 5th order and you figure the 5th order is perfect compared to 4th order, so you get error in the 4th order by checking against 5th order.  Then you say, "We have too much error!  Slow down. Or, speed up."

Stiff springs get tricky.  You have to make sure your model is conditioned.  Ill conditioned stiffy problems are bad.

Once in a while RK is awkward.  Doing collisions is easy -- just overlap springs.  Doing friction is kinda hard.  You supply a derivative function.  You don't really have a way of knowing how much normal force, so you can do static friction.  Maybe if I worked on it.

Somebody said China has problems because their people did not have morals when they switched to capitalism.  I don't know about how bad it is or isn't.  Pollution is a problem.

God likes birthrights.  It sounds unfair.  I've changed my young opinion.  I'm pretty sure God is against immigration, He recently said.  I was shocked.  Then, I thought about it.  Why is anti-immigration evil, on a philosophical level?  It actually solves a whole bunch of problems.  England can relax about overpopulation.  There sure are a lot of busybodies.  I guess, "do not litter" might apply, in a way to overpopulation.

There are wicked people who obsess and seeth with anger over population.  It is, undenyable, unfair.  One person shows restraint and others do not.  How can you say that is not unfair.  No-immigration, solves everything.  Brain drain?  Maybe, suddenly, those countries get better and everybody benefits.

It's funny.  I am normally the opposite of any idea which is populist.  I'm a snob.  I am chagrinned to be anti-immigration.  It sounds so low-class, working-man, labor union logic -- protectionist.  What's wrong with anti-immigration, though?  It's an ephiphany.  It's not evil.  Anti-immigration is not saying, "Go starve."  There is no obvious reason people should flow from one country into another.  That is not normal.  It's just as logical -- everybody stay put.

Technically, I don't know who my doctor is.  They have actors in the stores and stuff.  I'm sure the nominal person I meet with is an actor.  It's a different person every time.  The stubbornness seems like an Indian.  It seems like a stubborn atheist Indian.  Suppose you were in prison and the only way out was to explain a calculus problem to your guard.  Year after year after year would go by.  You just feel sick.  This person thinks the random number beacon is "bitcoin".  He thinks tongues is "Word salad."  Fucken nigger.

A grasp on exactly what my reality is... is not my strong point.  the people at OSDev make me look exceptional.  Something's wrong.  I'm in prision and none of the smart people I know exist are in contact.  I get a wake-up call of humility... almost... but the people around are not...

You know what's unfortunate?  As a kid, I thought the best thing in the world was progress.  Now, I frequently get scared.  Who's to say.  As a kid I thoughtlessly persued artificial intelligence like Frankenstein, though harmless.  I'm relaxed by the idea it's not easy.  I'm not certain, obviously, but I'm confident.

I don't know the state of things but let's just say I'm not very impressed by MRI's of brains showing which regions are active.  That's obviously, hilariously nothing!  I hear about geneome and ... I donno... 100,000 genes?  Whatever those things are, you are hilariuously far from anything scary.  Sometimes, I stand-up straight and say, "I'm not far from the best.  They seem pretty human."

How do I express this, I'm about to say?

There is a website called "Something awful."  It has pictures of grandma's that ... are depressing to any young adult... who doesn't want that wholesome, family, midwestern, old, dying, woman, mother...  a San Francisco single guy tries to squirm away from family wholesome...  He doesn't want Mom.

Okay, so that's my description of one kind of "awful".

So, there was a young atheist me, who might have... "Why don't they search for where spirituality comes from in the brain."

That is awful.  LOL.

Many of my immature thoughts are awful to me, now.

I guess you should let people mature.

I remember my mentor and friend Peter Gadwa had many things he passionately hated and had no tolerance of.  Now, I understand.  The young person does not know why buttons get pushed in mentors, but an old adult like me, may be seeing his old thought patterns which he, now, has contempt for.  (Or, could be other stuff.)  The old thoughst are unpleasant memories -- you want to squirm and get away.

I like Knuth.

I like my Mom.

I'm about average on reaction to old people.  It's doesn't cross my mind.  That site "Something awful", though, shows pictures of old ladies.  That's their strange theme for the site.  Weird site.

I guess my operating system must seem awful.  Maybe, some people want it out of sight.

I have become a vicious freak. Maybe, I'm like a war veteran.  I don't fit-in for sure.

I said Jews were "hideously viscious" cornered animals.

I'm hideously viscious.

It's not pleasant when you fear technology advancing more than looking forward to it.

Those robots were kinda hideous, LOL.  I don't want to ban stuff.  Some people sabotage progress.

My ridiculously awful operating system looks wonderfully harmless.  It's good, though.

If you want to be a hero, find something pleasant and peaceful for people to do, ideally making money.  I suggest making hymns.  Nobody does that for more than an hour here or there.  It's nice getting God to talk, though.
