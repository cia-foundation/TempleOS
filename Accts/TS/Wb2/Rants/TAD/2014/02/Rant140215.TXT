God's world is perfectly just.  Pleasures and pains balance, more or less.  You always get punished for sins, if you want to call them that.

Keep you relationship with God apart from sin.  Do not ask God to change justice.  Treat God as a person and talk to Him ignoring sin and Heaven and Hell.  That bores Him and is cowardly and is not loving Him.  Everybody just wants God's money.
