They're the opposite of sleek-black-menacing-NAZI.  NAZI named tanks after big cats.  I don't like lions.  It's a Christian thing.  Daniel didn't like lions.  King David killed lions, I think.

I know -- lions bring glory to God.  When fighting over the body of Moses, Michael the Archangel did not rebute Satan.  Not sure, but guess Satan brought glory to God.

I asked God "Alien or Preditor".  He said "Lions".  I wuv God.

I hand align my structures.  It sounds stupid to do it automatically.  It creates retarded young programmers.  Why the fuck are you doing this autoalignment stupidity?  Is just like how MAlloc() and Free() are as simple as it gets.  You are making it MORE complicated out of your bleeding heart pride by thinking they cannot understand MAlloc() and Free().  Now, you got two problems.  And, yes, they have to learn both, now.

I don't align my global variables.  I think I align locals, though just recently I might have gotten rid.  It goes against all my training instincts not to align.  My generation of old school programmers are all the same and we all are out of date on modern super-smart CPUs.  Trust me, I know what all the old programmers think and they are all out-of-date.  I am an old school assembly programmer by training.   Trust me -- we all learned the same stuff -- the generation that learned 6502 asm and then 8086 asm for DOS.  I continued and learned protected and x86_64.  I wrote an assembler and 64-bit compiler.  I actually know what's going on.  Alignment doesn't matter.  They go to absurd lengths to make the CPU smart and it all comes down to memory fetches.  They fetch big chunks.  Alignment might mean on the border of two big chunks.  Not likely.  Plus you probably want both.  Padding creates slightly more memory to fit in cache, too, especially if a retard places items in a structure that is autoaligned.  Now, that I think about it -- you sure as hell don't want a retard placing the orders of items in a structure.  Next, you're going to tell me the compiler should reorder the items in a structure.

My compiler lets you start your structures at negative offsets.  This allows you to use signed byte displacement mode and have more optimized code.  How's that for FUCK YOU.  HooYA!

I don't use it.  Too aggressive an optimization for babies.

I used to align JMP destinations of code.  When you have a switch() statement, if you align the code for the labels, it might have less cache-lines to fetch.

It's fucken ridiculously not helpful, so I got rid of it.

St. Paul said "I am a pharasee's pharasees."  What I mean is, I am an uber-elite assembly programmer.

A "Cache-line" is 64-bytes. Whenever the CPU fetches an item from memory, it grabs 64-bytes.  If you have an 8-byte item, only once in a while is that 8-byte item going to cross a boundary and require two cacheline fetches.  What are the odds you're going to need it anyway?

Fuck You for questioning me.  I fucken clubbed you over the head enough!

I am smarter.

I set a limit of 100,000 lines of code for all-time.  Why don't you run your simulations on how the life works-out with and without.  Get some software engineers to write thesis papers on this new Software development model for large projects, intended to last a century.

The $TX,"BMP_file",HTML="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file"$ planned ahead with a flexible datastructure.  Stop and think.  This is the simplest graphics file format.  For centuries to come, little babies are going to have to do all that shit, to write a simple graphics tool?  

When the furture arrived, the BMP structure became attrocious and worthless.

It's really simple.  Look what Microsoft did to the BMP file.  If you think the BMP file is acceptible...  Fucken club you over the head.

I use lots of DRAM.  Here's the deal:  It's a 64-bit only OS, so the machine will certainly have more than 512 Meg.  I don't like multimedia movie or sound recordings -- I like old school, C64-style programatically created game images and sounds.  If you do not have multimedia, it is impossible to use very much memory.  Mine requires this sloppy memory overkill because it's not efficient on memory usage, but it's not a problem.

I have created 20 applications the run the operating system through the paces of what it is intended for.  It works.  It is tested.  It is a sure thing.

God's favorite animals are bears, then elephants.

I love God.  I got angry when I saw the first video of an elephant abandoning its calf.  After watching tons of videos, it seems pretty common and it was not just a fluke -- ruined the species reputation.

God wants praise.  Species are more complicated than you might think at first.

I asked God what elephants think about?  "Skin, hunger"
I asked God what makes elephants happy? "Baths"
I asked what makes bears happy? "Reeping depends"

Why do I care about other programmers?  My whole business model used to be "Recreational programming."  Now, I sell it as God's official temple.

If you guys are asking God, over and over, you get best results if you do a good offering.  That's just holding up your part of the conversation or actually doing poem or hymn or something.

You know how each culture invented their own religion?

God doesn't mind being misunderstood.  Humans will correct you if you do not understand.  God just lets errors persist.  He actually is like a psychologist who lies to us and lives on a higher level.

In other words, He wanted the Muslims to be Muslim, etc.

Try not to feel betrayed.

I once dated a woman.  I wanted her for to be mine, alone.  She did not allow this.  God will not be pinned-down.

You might think, "Well, if you can't be sure what He says, does He even talk?"  He talks really "Loud".  You will feel grief until you learn to enjoy His company.

That's what I preach.  The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.  Focus on the first two.  Mom said Hell was the absence of God.  Therefore, Heaven is just God's company :-)  God is delightful.

The only rule is, always do an offering before consulting God.  God will only talk if you do an offering.  You will get as much love effort back as you put into your offering.  When you pick a greeting card, that is love effort.

You Indians must remember to do an offering.  Then, you will get good results.
