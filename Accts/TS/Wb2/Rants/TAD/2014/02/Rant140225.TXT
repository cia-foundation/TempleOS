The world being just seems more plausible when you look at all the different traits.  Some people make money.  They earn it, to some degree, though not always, but life finds a way to make it equal.  When you factor in the other facets of life, it becomes more plausable that it's just.

The truth is, it's an impossible question to answer for any single person.  Jesus said "If you laugh, you will weep; if you weep, you will laugh."  $TX,"Luke 6:20-26",HTML="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:20-26&version=NIV"$

To some degree, it is useless knowing the world is just because, we all want to make the right choice and it mostly comes down to pay now or pay later.  Half a dozen one way and six the other.  If you're like me, you go insane because you want to pick what's in your interest and, pretty-much, it sucks because there's no way to pick and get something for nothing.

On the other hand, knowing it is just helps because you might just forget about anything where you think you are getting something for nothing.  I'm not sure, but if you use your imagination you might trace how something actually is too good to be true.

This stuff is kinda disturbing and heavy, huh.  I'm not sure its good for everybody to know it.  I don't know what God wants.

1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
another with a pure heart fervently: 1:23 Being born again, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
liveth and abideth for ever.

1:24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
which by the gospel is preached unto you.

2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, all evil speakings, 2:2 As newborn babes, desire the
sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: 2:3 If so be ye
have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

2:4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
but chosen of God, and precious, 2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, are$FG$

They were feeding a bear.  He seemed like a glutton bear.  Then, I remembered they must gain a ton of weight.

You know what's amazing?  A female polar bear can give birth in the winter to two cubs in her den and nurse them for, like, two months, all on winter body fat!  That boggles my mind, when you look at how big they are.

Jesus said God cares for sparrows.  I watched a polar bear movie and I was afraid for the poor mother that she would get food.  Feed her, God!  Make sure.  They way they portrayed it, it looked like sooner or later she would not have luck and would starve, so it seemed like maybe God really did provide her every meal.

thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her

desolate.

disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

24:2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I
say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another,
that shall not be thrown down.

If you stop and think about all the wild sparrows, they can't go for more than a couple days without food, probably, how on Earth does their luck not run-out on a dry spell and they all starve?  God really does feed them, like Jesus said!  (He got it from $TX,"Psalm 50",HTML="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2050&version=NIV"$.)
