Every programmer has mental blocks.  All they can imagine is Linux.  They will look at the situation and tell me the next thing to do, making it just like Linux.

Dilbert's attitude is disrespecting managers.  I must manage myself.  Dilbert would make an exact copy of Linux, if you left it up to Dilbert.

I am a genius because I made new file format.  Microsoft can make BMP even worse, but we will all be using GRA files.  Once God is made public, I will get them to support it and we can eliminate BMP support.  Dilbert thinks more graphics file formats are better.  I think one graphics file format is best.  Dilbert thinks more file systems like Ext2 and stuff are better.  I want to get rid of FAT32 and ISO9660 and just have RedSea.  You cannot club Dilbert over the head hard enough to see that one file system is better than ten file systems; that one graphics file format is better than ten graphics file formats.

God talks.  When the World learns, suddenly the whole world knows.

Marketing is silly.

Use your head -- God's official temple with God talking.  There is no marketing plan.  I mean exactly what I say.  It is insanity to not see the obvious -- instant world domination without trying.  A world news reporter does a story, obviously, and that's it -- the entire World becomes aware of God.  Any other discussion is just silly.  It's retarded to pretend God's temple is just like anything else.
