My operating system is not networked, so there is not a malicious presence.  Mostly, my vision is that you don't use many 3rd party items.  It is safe, so it can be unprotected.  DOS was unprotected.

In Windows or Linux, you separate code and data for protection.  You only set the execute bit on code.  My compiler compiles one function at a time.  The string constants and floating point constants and jump table offsets are placed right after the code.  When you declare a global variable in a BIN module, it just skips a few bytes.  

I do not set and unset the execute bit.

I have a "code heap" and "data heap" however.  The data heap is for MAlloc, but I make extra heavy use of MAlloc since my stack cannot grow and MAlloc is safer.  Basically, don't have the habit of putting large items on the stack.

I put all code in the lowest 2 Gig of memory so I can use signed 32-bit addressing mode for CALL.

If you disagree with me, you are simply WRONG.
