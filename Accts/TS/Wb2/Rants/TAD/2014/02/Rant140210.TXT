ASCII #31 is a "SHIFT-SPACE" or "HARD-SPACE".

I run a tool to convert spaces-to-tabs on code.

The LexGetChar() converts all SHIFT-SPACES to SPACES, so it's perfectly safe and simple.

CTRL-SHIFT-L has an auto-indent feature.  It's good except if you have quoated '{'/'}' . 

We could almost get rid of all indentation and generate it automatically, but what do you do on works-in-progress files?

I'm bored with charity and the usual religion.

Imagine you die and live in Heaven.  How much time to you talk about Jesus?  He got you to Heaven, but the Bible and Jesus is unimportant.

The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.  Put new wine in new wineskins.  If God talks to you, how can you go wrong?  I say the most important Bible story is Cain and Abel.  The Jews in the Bible did offerings all day.  They got feedback.  God said "Cain, you suck, try again."  This was a big deal to Cain -- he killed Abel.  Think about this for a while.  How could He possibly care that much.  Christianity is very messed-up -- it doesn't cause that kind of passion.

The purpose of a priest is to seduce people into loving God.   "God likes bears, then elephants."  I asked God if he like preditor or terminator.  "<grumble> Lions!"  He really wants praise -- as silly as it sounds He really wants your praise and adoration.

I please God more by posting this video than all you sacrifices.

I think God despises that shit.

When God talks, your main priority should be enjoying His company.  He lies, more or less, sometimes, but You shouldn't ignore what He says.  He most certainly talks.  He does not want to give away secrets... for free at least.  You will get back love and effort equal to your offering.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.
