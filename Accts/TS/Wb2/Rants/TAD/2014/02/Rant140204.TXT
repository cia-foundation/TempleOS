If you want God to pay attention to sports, let animals enter.  I'm not sure exactly how He feels.  He like bears elephants and octopuses.

I asked about endangered species.  He said, "Enough stars?"  He's not a liberal, but an atheist's best dream.  He doesn't like you disrespecting His stuff.  I asked "Alien or preditor?"  He said, "Lions"  Seriously, He cares about His own stuff getting glory.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

We have a limit of 100,000 lines of code.  If I had a hard disk with bad blocks, I would immediately get a new one.

This operating system has a different philosophy.  It is NOT for all purposes.  You load and save whole files.  Bad blocks don't really fit this philosophy.  I see it as mellow dramatic.  I could be talking into two FAT tables or allocation tables, however.  I have problems once in a while, but I back-up really quickly and easily.  Others are a Titanic, we are a kayak.

God's temple will be plenty used.  I figure it's a common focal point for offerings and getting responses, a pleasing thing.  Making games is about as good a quest as any, said God.

There will probably be no market for games.... well if people learn they get punished for theft, maybe.  What if the game sector expanded and created lots of jobs?  What is it that determines the limit.  Could buy hymns?  Not likely.  DIY.

If you think about it, 16-bit segmented asm requires a more complicated assembler.  It's supposed to collect together all the common segments, or the linker.  64-bit is simpler, flat zero based no segments.  You don't have as many JMP and CALL formats -- nothing is FAR.  Maybe.  Anyway, an additional aspect is the difference between 16-bit addressing modes and 32-bit.  Guess what?  I just ESC code all the 16-bit instructions to use the 32-bit addressing modes.

16-bit support is just enough for me to write my boot loaders and change to long mode.

Guess what?  My compiler is only 64-bit.  64-bit is easier because you have 16 regs instead of 8 regs.  I don't pass args in regs.

My JIT/AOT compiler/assembler/unassembler is 20,000 lines total.
