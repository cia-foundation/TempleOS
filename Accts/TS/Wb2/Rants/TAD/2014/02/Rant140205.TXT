4:24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is
Agar.

4:25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

4:26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
all.

4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many
more children than she which hath an husband.

4:28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

4:30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
of the freewoman.

4:31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
the free.$FG$

The atheist evolution obsessed people desperately want to be smart.  A Chinese woman fed her kids cow brains.  The atheist want to read books to make them smart.  They should seek wisdom by reading the Bible over and over.  You get wisdom by rereading -- gleaning.  That is a hard lesson for them because they want to read many high-brow books in a desperate attempt, like the Chinese woman.  It's kinda pathetic.
