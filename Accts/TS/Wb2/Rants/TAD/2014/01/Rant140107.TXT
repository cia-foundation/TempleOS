When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP"$
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP"$	:1004
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  $LK,"DCSave",A="MN:DCSave"$(), $LK,"GRAWrite",A="MN:GRAWrite"$(), $LK,"DCLoad",A="MN:DCLoad"$(), and $LK,"GRARead",A="MN:GRARead"$().  $LK,"::/Kernel/Compress.CPP"$




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

The only graphics file format that is not clusterfucked is .BMP and they just added color-reordering, so now it is clusterfucked.  They made the format flexible and it became clusterfucked.

Silly people -- in 1990 at age 20, my first assignment when working on Ticketmaster's operating system was CheckDsk/Fix. VMAP

In 2004, OSNews and the NSA were tormenting me over FAT32.  You know how they like to grieve me with torment on any weakness.  In 2004, I said, "I need to make a filesystem that does not violate the FAT patent."  I could do like the Commodore 64 and put block chain pointers at the end of each block.  (The niggers mocking me are so retarded they cannot imagine even one alternative to FATs, how much you want to bet?)  

So, the C64 had pointers in the last two bytes of each 256 byte disk block that pointed to the next in the chain.  God that's awful!! LOL.  Fuck.  How do I not use FAT tables?  Ticketmaster had an allocation bitmap, instead of FAT.  They used a hash table for disk directroru entries.  It's high performance.  Contiguous files are higher performance.  

Ticketamster did ordered-IO to rearrange disk block head movements for best results, like elevator.

Anyway, so I made a filessystem without FAT.  And, I got used to it, and liked it.  I copied cluster concept from FAT, but now I have just one sector per cluster--that is true to my mission.  

Ticketamster had account numbers.  The numbers were block number on a drive with no filesystem.  They did file IO as block offsets with block-read and block-write, for highest performance.

I got used to whole-file access and not growing files.  You can do compression!!  How cool is that?!!

I simplified all my code by loading and saving whole files.

My highest goal is low line count and simple code.

I don't care if it can crash, under abuse.

I don't care if it won't do everything -- use Windows.

We already have one Linux.  You fucken retards -- if you turn it into Linux, you have a wortheless thing.

My highest goal is low line count.

My vision is a C64, not a main frame.

The choice is clear -- a programmer in BASIC with mine, or a nigger with HTML with Windows/Linux.  That is the difference in the visions.

Except mine is not BASIC.

BASIC is simple on purpose.  A complicated BASIC is beyond stupid!  It's a shitty language if it is not super simple.

Any genius can make asynchronous IO.  Assume I knew everything you knew when I was 20.  Modern artists stopped doing photorealism but they were experts at photorealism painting.

A supergenius makes it simple.

I am a supergenius.  Why else did God pick me?  I have God-level IQ as you can see from the way FAT32 resolved itself.  That how everything fell into place.

You guys are pathetically vehemently fighting the last war with pathetic little brains that spout unoriginal Linux ideology very arrogantly, like you should be admired for genius and not supergenius thinking.  There are a hundred geniuses on the planet.  Any genius can do asynchronous I/O.  I'm not impressed.  It's nasty ass fugly code.  My highest goal is low line count.

In 1990 at age 20, I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system in VAX assembly language while going to school.  I was basically, an intern, but we weren't called that.  I worked there 1990-1996.  Here are my $TX,"ASU Transcripts",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/files/ASU_Transcripts.pdf"$.

In about 1993, I got a 486 and was eager to try 32-bit mode, so I wrote a DOS program in TASM that changed to protected mode and never returned to DOS.  Ticketmaster's OS was "VAXTMOS", so I called mine "Terry's Protected Mode OS, TPMOS".  I had 0xB8000 text mode working, and echoed keyboard to screen.  I had simple multitasking and barely a MALLOC.  I set it asside.

In 2003, I resurrected TPMOS and installed FreeDOS to launch it.  I used Visual Studio to edit my files when doing lots of editing, then booted FreeDOS, used TASM to compile and test it.  Back in those days, FreeDOS ran in real mode.  Today's FreeDOS is not real mode, it emulates with V8086 mode.  DOSBox is not real mode either.

I had started a company H.A.R.E., so I renamed TPMOS to HOPPY.

I named it Doors, DAVOS, J, LoseThos, SparrowOS and, finally, TempleOS.

That's hilarious--less computing power?  I want a 72-Core Intel Knights Landing beast.  I want much more computing power.

Basically, a GPU is like a 1000 core chip because it does it's job well.  You seem to not understand that a GPU is like a 1000 core chip.  I have to put this in terms you can understand.  A nigger thinks a GPU doesn't matter.  A nigger thinks you don't need a GPU.  You don't if you have 640x480 and a 4Ghz 8 core Corei7.

$FG,4$15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was
bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

15:11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
believed.

15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?  15:13 But
if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
faith is also vain.

15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if
so be that the dead rise not.

15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 15:17 And
if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.$FG$
