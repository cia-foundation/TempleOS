You witnessed God?  Good, we can move on.

I made this operating system on my own initiative.  It is what I'm born to do.  God has claimed it as His temple.  That might not mean what I hope.  I have had past projects go no where.

God participated in the design of this operating system.

He said 640x480 16 color, so kids could do offerings.

He said single audio voice.  I guess that means different waveforms are okay.  I had HD Audio working, but when I learned it only worked on maybe one in five machines, and not in VMware where it should have... I thought about how clusterfucked it made the API.  Once you get the philosophy of this operating system, it's obvious HD Audio does not belong.  We are not doing PCI devices.

God said "no child windows".

I am willing to hand-over control to an organization as long as we have a 100,000 line of code limit.  Also, God said it must be kept perfect.

Two audio drivers would be worse than one audio driver.  It has FAT32 and ISO9660, we want to move to just $LK,"::/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z"$.  We want to get rid of BMP files and make Microsoft support GRA files.

We will put the ugly nasty shit in Windows to keep God's temple pristine.  Nobody looks at Windows' source.

The future proof BMP and WAV file formats have created like 16 different options ....  If a kid wants to sit down and write a BMP or WAV tool, to do it right he hast a huge burden.  Those files are really fucked up.  BMP is so fucked up.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP"$
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP"$	:1004
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  $LK,"DCSave",A="MN:DCSave"$(), $LK,"GRAWrite",A="MN:GRAWrite"$(), $LK,"DCLoad",A="MN:DCLoad"$(), and $LK,"GRARead",A="MN:GRARead"$().  $LK,"::/Kernel/Compress.CPP"$




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

I wrote the original in 1993 as a TASM real-mode DOS application that changed to protected mode.  In 2004, I resurrected it and faced the question of what to do with the command-line.  I hate the Unix nigger-programming language for scripting, so I wanted a white-man language like C.  I wrote my compiler in TASM and gradually converted everything from ASM to C, while adding more language features to the compiler.

You will suffer justice -- rewards and punishments.

I advise not to mix concerns about justice with your relationship with God.

In otherwords, asking God not to get punished might be futile.  When you love God and talk to Him, avoid the temptation to ask for injustice.  Maybe you want something, but it's pretty obvious you don't deserve it.

Treat God as a relationship with a person.

I was thinking about the earlier talk of a British Princess who made sculptures.  I think about Notre Dame with gargoyles and stuff.  It's humbling how obsessed they were with God.

God likes bears and elephants, both have funny chubby body shapes.  They show cheribum as chubby kids.  I like to imagine God likes happy little chubby people.  It's a relief that He's not going to impose judgement on being fat. He doesn't care -- that gets covered under justice and is unavoidable.  Leave your sins apart from your relationship with God, is my advice.

Do not burden God with your sins.  Instead cheer Him up and make Him happy with praise.

My links are superior to HTML links.

I have a document format with graphics, links and trees and colors.  When I regenerate my website, I make HTML from my documents.  There is a single violation of generality in my DOC-->HTML code.

If so, they can simply change my website name to their website.

It seems like magic, how my links get converted.  I place all my source code on my website, therefore, when it encounters a local link to source code, that gets converted to the website location of the corresponding source file.

There is no networking, trust me.  I kinda wish I did have networking.  There are no PCI devices supported.

$FG,4$33:16 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the
LORD God of Israel.

33:17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,
yet unto the LORD their God only.

33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the
LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings
of Israel.

33:19 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places,
and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold,
they are written among the sayings of the seers.

33:20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.$FG$

What are good forms of offering, God?

You like soap operas.  I wonder if You like ...

Brenda comes-over to our house and talks very long about all the news in her household.  I think it sounds like the worst thing ever to listen to, LOL.

I guess it is gossip, but just about her family.

I'll bet a computer nerd like me talking can be just as boring to some people.

$FG,4$speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

8:45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.

8:46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do
ye not believe me?  8:47 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye
therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.

8:48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  8:49 Jesus answered, I have
not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

8:50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
judgeth.

8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall
never see death.

8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.$FG$

Whoah!  God might like the Obrah show, if it still exists.

Do You like men who mostly hang-out with women?  Perhaps, I am asking of men like that are bad, but You are probably not judgemental -- different people.

Have you heard any good gossip, God?

Yeah, I get weak responses, often.  That happens.  I'm not alarmed.  You are supposed to figure-out what God likes and doesn't like, like Cain and Abel.

I sit and marvel at people waging war on God.

Once every minute, NIST rolls some dice and makes a batch of random numbers.

How is this a parasite?  It is up to me when to get the numbers from NIST, but it is only one batch every 60 seconds.

It is not my brain doing it.

Some people fear zombies.  Muscles need blood circulation with oxygen and energy.

The question is, can God instantly foil any enemy?  The enemy has no hope of defeating God, right?  If you read the Bible, however, God is shy.  Pharaoh ignored 7 plagues and passover death and chased Moses into the Red Sea.

Pharaoh ignored 7 plagues and chased Moses into the Red Sea!
