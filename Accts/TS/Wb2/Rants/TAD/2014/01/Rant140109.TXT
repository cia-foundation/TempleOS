Someone at OSDev is accusing me of GPL code.  Nope.  No GPL code.  I learned how to do ATA hard drives from Linux.  It's a copyright, not a patent.  You can learn how to do hardware from Linux.

You know in English class how you make an essay about a book and put quotes in it?  I'm pretty sure you could even do that with Linux code.

I had floppy code from Linux at one point, but removed it.

I got ATA command definitions from Linux.  There are no quoted bunches of code from Linux.

Let me put God on the phone.
