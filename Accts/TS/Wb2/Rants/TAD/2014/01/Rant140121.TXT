When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

Brendan is talking, some of it shit.  He had a good idea -- he just reminded me of something from my early compiler.

When I first did my compiler, my types for my expressions were really simple and beautiful compiler code, but not standard.  I had to make my compiler junky to fix it.  It's a good thought, but I don't think we want the primative type system I had -- not friendly and difficult.

I had a neat compiler feature -- my pointer arithmetic was always size one byte objects.  It was neat.  It's a really really tough call, but I switched to standard C pointer arithmetic.  Standard C is ugly in the compiler.

I did post-fix type-casting because standard C was too ugly.  I'm happy with it.  It's too awful doing it normally.

You know what's funny?  I crack-up laughing at the people who insist top-down order of functions, LOL.  They fight the compiler.  They uses a low level function in a high level by putting a header before, then they define it after the use.  A French guy said, "Milk is for baby cows."  LOL  I think that's the funniest thing.

See $LK,"#exe {}",A="FF:::/Kernel/KEnd.CPP,#exe {"$ for an example where the date/time and compile-time prompting for cfguration data is placed into a program.  $LK,"StreamPrint",A="MN:StreamPrint"$() places text into a src program stream following the conclusion of the $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ blk.

* No $FG,2$#define$FG$ functions exist (I'm not a fan)

* No $FG,2$typedef$FG$, use $FG,2$class$FG$.

* No type-checking

* Can't use $FG,2$<>$FG$ with $FG,2$#include$FG$, use $FG,2$""$FG$.

* "$FG,2$$$$FG$" is an escape character.  Two dollar signs signify an ordinary $$.  See $LK,"::/Doc/Dollar.TXT"$.  In $FG,2$asm$FG$ or $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ code, it also refers to the instruction's addr. 

* $FG,2$union$FG$ is more like a class, so you don't reference it with a $FG,2$union$FG$ label after you define it.  Some common unions are declared in $LK,"Adam1a.HPP",A="MN:U16"$ for 1,2,4 and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration, that is the type when used by itself.  See $LK,"::/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP"$. 

* $FG,2$class$FG$ member vars can have meta data. $FG,2$fmtstr$FG$ and $FG,2$fmtdata$FG$ are two meta data types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the compiler's info about classes and vars.  See $LK,"::/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP"$ and  $LK,"DocFormDo",A="MN:DocFormDo"$().

* There is a keyword $FG,2$lastclass$FG$ you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class name of the previous arg.  See $LK,"ClassRep",A="MN:ClassRep"$().

* See $LK,"::/Demo/Exceptions.CPP"$.  $FG,2$try{} catch{}$FG$ and $FG,2$throw$FG$ are different from C++. $FG,2$throw$FG$ is a function with a char arg.  The char string passed in $FG,2$throw()$FG$ can be accessed from within a $FG,2$catch{}$FG$ using the $FG,2$Fs->except_ch$FG$.  Within a $FG,2$catch {}$FG$ blk, set the var $FG,2$Fs->catch_except$FG$ to $FG,2$TRUE$FG$ if you want to terminate the search for a handler.  Use $LK,"PutExcept",A="MN:PutExcept"$() as a handler, if you like.

* A function is available similar to $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ which provides the offset of a member of a class.  It's called $FG,2$offset$FG$.  You place the class name and member inside as in $FG,2$offset(classname.membername)$FG$.  It has nothing to do with 16-bit code.  Both $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ and $FG,2$offset$FG$ only accept one level of member vars.  That is, you can't do $FG,2$sizeof(classname.membername.submembername)$FG$.$FG$

* There is no $FG,2$continue$FG$ statement.  Use $FG,2$goto$FG$.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access $LK,"library routines",A="HI:Bit"$.

* $FG,2$lock{}$FG$ can be used to apply asm $FG,2$LOCK$FG$ prefixes to code for safe multicore read-modify-write accesses.  The code bracked with have $FG,2$LOCK$FG$ asm prefix's applied to relevant instructions within.  It's a little shoddy.  See $LK,"::/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP"$.

* There is a function called $LK,"MSize",A="MN:MSize"$() which gives the size of an object allocated off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to a power of two, so $FG,2$MSize()$FG$ lets you know the real size and you can take full advantage of it.

* You can $LK,"Free",A="MN:Free"$() a $FG,2$NULL$FG$ ptr.  Useful variants of $LK,"MAlloc",A="MN:MAlloc"$() can be found $LK,"Here",A="MN:CAlloc"$.  Each task has a heap and you can $FG,2$MAlloc$FG$ and $FG,2$Free$FG$ off of other task's heaps, or make an independent heap with $LK,"HeapCtrlBPInit",A="MN:HeapCtrlBPInit"$().

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change $LK,"DFT_STK",A="MN:DFT_STK"$ and recompile $FG,2$Kernel$FG$ or request more when doing a $LK,"Spawn",A="MN:Spawn"$().  You can use $LK,"CallStkGrow",A="MN:CallStkGrow"$(), but it's odd.  See $LK,"::/Demo/StkGrow.CPP"$. 

* Only one base class is allowed.

* All values are extended to 64-bit when accessed.  Intermediate calculations are done with 64-bit values.

$ID,2$The follow examples should be inserted in a function, so that reg variables are used.  (Global vars are never reg.)

$FG,2$I16 i;
I32 j;
j=i=0x12345678; //Resulting i is 0x5678 but j is 0x12345678

I64 i=0x8000000000000000;

Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0x40000000

$LK,"MPrint",A="MN:MPrint"$() is like $LK,"SPrint",A="MN:SPrint"$() but it returns a $LK,"MAlloc",A="MN:MAlloc"$ated str.  It is vary handy because you don't have to worry about overflow.

$LK,"Auto",A="MN:Auto"$(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the current task's input buffer.
$LK,"AutoStr",A="MN:AutoStr"$(U8 *fmt,...) sends text of an $LK,"AutoFile",A="FF:::/Doc/Glossary.TXT,AutoFile"$ to the keyboard stream of the current TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

$LK,"XTalk",A="MN:XTalk"$(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) and text to another task's input buffer.
$LK,"XTalkStr",A="MN:XTalkStr"$(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) sends text of an $LK,"AutoFile",A="FF:::/Doc/Glossary.TXT,AutoFile"$ to the keyboard stream of another TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

$LK,"DocPrint",A="MN:DocPrint"$(CDoc *doc,U8 *fmt,...) sends text to a document.  You can buffer to a Doc and save it, providing the functionality of $FG,2$fprintf$FG$.  See $LK,"::/Demo/Dsk/FPrintF.CPP"$.

$LK,"Adam",A="MN:Adam"$(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the adam task to be compiled and run.
$LK,"AdamLog",A="MN:AdamLog"$(U8 *fmt,...) and $LK,"AdamErr",A="MN:AdamErr"$(U8 *fmt,...) send text to the adam task to be displayed.

$LK,"StreamPrint",A="MN:StreamPrint"$(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the stream of code being compiled and must reside in a $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ blk.

$LK,"GrPrint",A="MN:GrPrint"$(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y,U8 *fmt,...) and $LK,"GrVPrint",A="MN:GrVPrint"$() plots text in graphics mode.

$LK,"ExePrint",A="MN:ExePrint"$(U8 *fmt,...) compiles and execute a string.  Note: It returns the result of the last executed expression.

$LK,"AFPrint",A="MN:AFPrint"$(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) $LK,"PutChars",A="MN:PutChars"$()s one at a time with a delay.

$LK,"RawPrint",A="MN:RawPrint"$(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) sends direct to screen memory, bypassing window manager.

$BK,1$Note:$BK,0$ Use $FG,2$Print("%s",src)$FG$ if you need an unmodified string.

$FG,4$they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return

4:13 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the
higher places, I even set the people after their families with their
swords, their spears, and their bows.

4:14 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the
rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them:
remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your
brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.

4:15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned
all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.

4:16 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the
spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers
