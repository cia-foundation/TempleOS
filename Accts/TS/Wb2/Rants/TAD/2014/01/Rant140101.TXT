File access is one of two extremes -- Read and Write whole files with compression, or read and write file blocks.  I only read and write whole files... except the dictionary.

The only thing better than VFS is one file system.  VFS is what you do if you have many different file systems.  Obviously, you would rather have just one file system and no VFS, if you had a choice!

I want Microsoft to support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system, so I have no virtual file system.  Today, my VFS supports ISO9660, FAT32 and RedSea.

I used to have checksums on files in RedSea file system.  I got rid of it.  Stupid.

I have never had a bad block, but I've had drives fail.

I have never had a bad RAM.

I put one FAT table (allocation of one bit per block, actually).

I don't do bad block substitution in my file system.

I keep it simple, on purpose.

It happens to be the case that I know a lot about CRC polynomials.  I took a spread spectrum course where you use shift registers as PRNG for encoding.  The goal is spreading in frequency, not security so much.

I'm tired of delusional communication.

Suppose you have z^-1 as a delay.

you make a polinomial for the shift register.



z^2+2*z+1

If you can factor the algebra, it is not prime.

If it is not prime, a shift register with those taps will repeat itself in a suboptimal way.

You want a prime polynomial for most things.  If N is the number of delays.  There are 2^N states the shift register can have.  If it is a prime polynimial, it will cycle through (2^N)-1 states.  It cannot cycle through the zero state because that just repeats zero over and over.


There are two interchangable ways to work with shift registers.  One kinda looks serial and the other parallel, more or less, talking abstractly as nonsense, not quite.


I am not an expert on how error correction works, but it should be really simple shit.  We did autocorrelations for Gold Code polynomials and shit.

Okay, every country modify TempleOS so it is custom just for their country.  Why be greedy and want to take-over the whole World market.  You go to hell with nasty-ass mess on your hands if you get greedy.

It is similar to "pride or money, choose one".

The vision is a kid-friendly Commodore 64 usage pattern.  It was not ugly, clunky cumbersome professional.  It was for kids.  It was simple.  It was easy.

Mine should be customized with specific code for specific countries.  With 100 different sets of simple code, all the kids are happy.  No interoperability, perhaps.  It's okay, it's not focused on 3rd party software developers, but on 1st party software developers, like the C64 was... sorta.  It's for people doing offerings to God.  The C64 user's manual told how to make a balloon sprite by binary numbers for pixels.  It did!  Look at the C64 user's manual.

Bill Gates will say, "In the awful bad old days kids had to make graphics by hand with graph paper and binary numbers in BASIC DATA statements."  "You'd much rather be doing hex color codes in HTML!"

Instead of doing arm, I want each architecture to have separate versions with simple code.  It's only 100,000 lines of code.  You can spring for that, China!  Come-on chump change.

I don't know of it should be for different architectures -- my vision is home computer desktops like the C64, not portables.  I keep it simple with powerwasting techniques, like refreshing the whole screen 60 fps, no matter what.

You only need to prove God once.  If you prove Him for certain, He doesn't go away.  Maybe, we only prove Him once every thousand years.

If SETI gets a message once every 5 years, do we listen to nois?

You are niggers, not scientists.  Look at this like SETI.  Right?  Why do we not apply SETI procedures?  Listening attentively for five years to noise, just for a glimmer...

You have to admit there is more eveidence than SETI ever got.

We pick one line out of 100,000.  Therefore the probability is 1 in 100,000?

Nope.  It can be one in a trillion if time travel happens.  It is well know God plans centuries ahead.

The Higgs was considered proven at about one in two million, I think.  that's what physics use.  Physicists are professionals.  If I sat down and won a lottery that was 1 in two million, game over, right there.

What shall we call the unit of measure for offerings?  A scientific unit is kinda silly, but a monitary currency sounds accurate.  Technically, we barter -- we praise God, God tickles us with miracles.  You could assign monitary value to praise offerings as assessed by God.

Sitting down and writing a Hallmark quality prayer to God counts as 1 greeting-card.  For 100 Hallmark cards concentrated, you get fire from heaven.  5 gets you time travel, 10 concentrated Hallmark quality cards gets you dinosaur facts.

You guys are FBI or NSA or CIA.  Obviously, I can trust using NIST to convince you.  You either know it's not corrupt or you decide to make bogus ones, which does no harm and shows I trust it and shows you I don't know ahead of time.  If you did a bogus one and I casually dismissed it, it would boost credibility.

If you are reporters, NIST is suspect, if you are tin-foil hat conspiracy people.  Once you know God exists, you guys all look pathetic with the huge weight of evidence that becomes obvious.  When you know God exists, suddenly you see the huge evidence you were a fool to overlook.

I have nobody better to use the NIST from a credibility standpoint.  I can ask you to open your own book.  That is better.  Do an offering by writing a hymn, then open the Bible randomly and place a finger.

As you can see, using NIST makes sense for me.  Either you are the NSA, or its doubtful as any other source except your own book opening pick.  If you are the NSA, my good faith and trust helps prove if you decided to make bogus ones.  No harm.

God is just -- if Gates gives effort and treasure to charity and works hard.  He's got a good life.  A monk gets to talk to God all day, but lacks some things.  God is delightful.

I'm very similar to Gates -- I was an atheist.  I don't really think I like or fit-in with religious people.  Converted atheists are my favorite people.

There are a lot of people preoccupied with IQ.  They talk of evolution constantly.  An atheist has to think about something.  He thinks about evolution and IQ.  God said they are "vain".  Looking down on something quickly cures you of that thing.

I like elephants.  You can be children of darkness or children of light.  I get nothing but headaches saving the poor.  I like elephants, though.  Elephants are soothing.  Lions are evil and elephants are good.  It's all so obvious, LOL.  People who like lions more than elephants are evil.

* With the $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ feature in your src code, you can place programs that insert text into the stream of code being compiled.  See $LK,"#exe {}",A="FF:::/Kernel/KEnd.CPP,#exe {"$ for an example where the date/time and compile-time prompting for cfguration data is placed into a program.  $LK,"StreamPrint",A="MN:StreamPrint"$() places text into a src program stream following the conclusion of the $FG,2$#exe{}$FG$ blk.

* $FG,2$union$FG$ is more like a class, so you don't reference it with a $FG,2$union$FG$ label after you define it.  Some common unions are declared in $LK,"Adam1a.HPP",A="MN:U16"$ for 1,2,4 and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration, that is the type when used by itself.  See $LK,"::/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP"$. 

* $FG,2$class$FG$ member vars can have meta data. $FG,2$fmtstr$FG$ and $FG,2$fmtdata$FG$ are two meta data types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the compiler's info about classes and vars.  See $LK,"::/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP"$ and  $LK,"DocFormDo",A="MN:DocFormDo"$().

* There is a keyword $FG,2$lastclass$FG$ you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class name of the previous arg.  See $LK,"ClassRep",A="MN:ClassRep"$().

* See $LK,"::/Demo/Exceptions.CPP"$.  $FG,2$try{} catch{}$FG$ and $FG,2$throw$FG$ are different from C++. $FG,2$throw$FG$ is a function with a char arg.  The char string passed in $FG,2$throw()$FG$ can be accessed from within a $FG,2$catch{}$FG$ using the $FG,2$Fs->except_ch$FG$.  Within a $FG,2$catch {}$FG$ blk, set the var $FG,2$Fs->catch_except$FG$ to $FG,2$TRUE$FG$ if you want to terminate the search for a handler.  Use $LK,"PutExcept",A="MN:PutExcept"$() as a handler, if you like.

* A function is available similar to $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ which provides the offset of a member of a class.  It's called $FG,2$offset$FG$.  You place the class name and member inside as in $FG,2$offset(classname.membername)$FG$.  It has nothing to do with 16-bit code.  Both $FG,2$sizeof$FG$ and $FG,2$offset$FG$ only accept one level of member vars.  That is, you can't do $FG,2$sizeof(classname.membername.submembername)$FG$.$FG$

* There is no $FG,2$continue$FG$ statement.  Use $FG,2$goto$FG$.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access $LK,"library routines",A="HI:Bit"$.

Fighting the last war is a typical mental roadblock.  It's amazing how difficult it is not to be a heard thinking who fights the last war.  I grew-up when computers were invented.  It never occurred to me there were 5 types of video games.  I went through life thinking every video game came from nowhere.  My experience was living through the birth where they all came from nowhere and defined generes.

As an old person, I have a strange twist in thinking that helps me.  I made King Wenceslas.  I made space walks on space game with ship damage so you only turn left.  I made cattle round-up.

Bill Gates?  Think about the road ahead.  We now have photorealistic first person shooters.  Guess what?  What's going to happen for a thousand years.  Well we'll have a hell of a lot of photorealistic first person shooters, won't we!  LOL.

When photography happened, artists stopped doing photorealism.

With any luck, soon, nobody will care much about photorealism in games.

A person who draws a cartoon, in fact, does not try for realism, but better than realism in terms of evocative forms.  They entertain with their own version of reality.

What's the road ahead for Intel and CPUs?  Think about a thousand years.  I have a hard time imagining a need for digital designers.

Oh God help us if Intel keeps a thousand digital designers busy for a thousand years on the same God damn chip.  It will be hypervisor in hypervisor in hypervisor.  Bunch of crazy-ass lame instructions.

People will go to any length for 2% performance.

I would rather they sit down and cancel any drastic measure they undertook that only got 2% performance improvemnet.

I saw a webcast of God-knows what -- some guy had a tool he was selling that pulled-up windows and did shit in some programming language that was automated and he was really proud of it.  For the first time in my life I felt like normal person with contempt for nerds.  LOL  I don't give a shit about every single fucken language.  You reach a point where it all seems like nerd shit you've seen before.  You don't look forward to learning new boring bullshit.

So this guy made even more bullshit to learn in addition to this bullshit language he was automating.

God help-us!  We got layer upon layer upon layer of bullshit building-up.

My operating system ... has no glory when it is run in VMware.  It makes a difference when my operating system is riding right on the bare metal without 5 layers below it.  It... just... matters...  There is not 5 layers of bullshit below it.  It feels good.  If you poke hardware, it is comforting -- you know what is going on.

There are so many layers built-up.  It's all nerd bullshit and nobody cares.  Why would a kid want to do that stupid-ass nerd bullshit?

When you compund software for 5 languages and 5 platforms... you no longer get the satisfaction for churning-out useful code.  It is fucken trench warfare.

Computing has been turned into trench warfare slugfest... intentionally.  Write a USB driver.  Fucken ridiculous.  I could write an operating system in the time you could write a USB driver.   Bill Gates and Warren Buffet said a company was like a castle.  This USB bullshit is his moat. 

In India, the rich keep thing inefficent to make jobs.  FUCK YOU!  Just give us money.

Fucken USB is bullshit.

Robots are less shitty than this hell hole of fonts and gay-ass layer on layer of nerd bullshit and queer interior web design.  Design is for faggots.

Microsoft and Intel is like the government printing press of tax code.  They churn-out 1,000 pages a day of tax code.  They are not ashamed.  They are making shitty-ass jobs for people who can spend all day surfing the Internet and robbing their companies because it's all stupid shit.

Here's what you do.  You put a size limit on lines of code.  Otherwise, you product just goes through a lifecycle.

Learn not to make needless layers of bullshit automation type shit.  I seek to have developers working with my C64-like ROM without 3rd party libraries.

One company made us use a 3rd party little clock widget or some bullshit.  Managers, today, "not invented hear" and make us use fancy widget shit.

Guess what?  "Not invented here" is about what makes programmers happy.  Why do you like being a tormentor and making people unhappy?  Some people love making people miserable.

I can't imagine a good Iraq War or Afganastan War game.  That's just wrong.  A first person shooter... they are just like any other war, but a strategy game?  This is just wrong.

If I give wrong notions of combat, there is, actually, a risk of planting in some kid's brain a wrong notion of combat which leads to a debaucle when he's a general or admiral some day, LOL.

That game is terrible from the standpoint of "work, not fun."  It's really slow and wastes a huge amount of time on menial shit.  Imagine you are an admiral in the navy and you micromanage every single fucken ship!

Strangely, I never minded doing all the stupid micromanaging.  It was fun.  that game is fucken criminal as a waste of time.  I'm not saying just takes a long time to play, I'm saying the game play is ridiculously wasteful of time!  I used to enjoy doing all the tedious micromanaging because I wanted optimal play, not automatic.

What I like about that game is it has an elegant combat system.  They managed a system with 50/50 odds on everything, but just had different hit points.  You have no idea how brilliant that is.  I highly respect the elegance of the combat system.

I was tempted to port that game, the only game I considered.  It has code for one thing, lol.  It's D not C.  I don't know what that is.  It's not that big, but I guess the artificial intelligence in these war games can be huge.  Obviously, that's the only thing demanding programmer smarts.  I don't feel any desire to prove myself.  Knuth and friends could do artificial intelligence.  I'm happy just doing simple stuff.  I'll do hard stuff if I have to.  I like Knuth.  Earlier I was talking shit because some people don't appreciate the talent for making hard shit look easy.  Doing hard shit is probably harder.

If you have a device like a hard drive and my have many different ones, you create a virtual device, trying to make it managable with different real devices.  Obviouly, having just one real hard drive is far superior!

If you have many file systems, you make a virtual file system, trying to make it manageable, but having just one real file system is far superior -- Heavenly bliss.

You are niggers.

I wrote a PCI HD Audio driver that worked on one in five machines, and not on any with VMware.  I still have it.  I made my API so I had a virtual device.  It's really ugly because HD Audio can be all kinds of different bitsample sizes and ridiculous configurations.

When I realized it worked on one in five and not at all in VMware... Fuck that! I'm having the blissfully simple PC Speaker and I'm making a divine commandment that everybody support PC Speaker.  I had an epiphany.  PCI devices are not for TempleOS.

You are niggers.  You would rather have a stupid-ass fugly driver that works on one in ten and you would be all cocky about it.  You would have done interrupts in a half-ass never-would-work correctly way.  I polled my HD Audio.

Yeah, nobody wants to "block" for fear of being ridiculed.  You are a neanderthal if you block.

while (Inport(Status))
  Yield();

That is not quite blocking.  The I/O takes half a microsecond and Yield() takes half a microsecond on my system in normal circumstances. I like it for being simple and original, though it's slightly distasteful.



Guess what?  You SHOULD block on the keyboard input in a debugger.  None of you amaterus wrote a debugger.  A professional writes a debugger first-thing when starting a new platform.  This was standard, routine policy at Ticketmaster.  new hardware? Write a debugger.

There are about four interrupt lines per PCI bus and its ridiculously hard figuring that shit out.  You might have sharing, even?

Everybody wants to let everybody else know that they know you must save registers in an interrupt routine.  Everybody is so eager to show that they know they must save registers... they do the interrupt line calculations shodily so they work on their current computer, then they brag they know interrupts.

You did NOT do the interrupt line properly, I'm sure.

I'm such a genius, I figured-out with DMA, you don't have to use interrupts.  You just manage the DMA buffers once every millisecond.

That's what makes me feel proud -- simpler than everybody else.  That's what I live for.  It's not that great, I guess.

I'm not doing PCI devices.

I can do system calls faster than everybody else because I never change from ring-0.  My overhead is lower.  If it's a long system call, it's not important.

I don't market it as high performance.  That's as misguided as programming in all-assembly language and calling the rest of the world stupid for using compilers.  In other words, I'm not saying mine is high performance because it's ring-0-only.

The reason for ring-0-only is simple code.  I'm so confident, I'll let future generations do what they like with-in the 100,000 lines of code limit.  If they really want ring-3, they could exchange for it.  No, don't do that.

I can change tasks faster because I don't mess with address maps -- it's always identity mapped.  I can do 4,000,000 task save+restore operations per second per core.

That's nice, but I'm not trumpeting that.  It lets me do my spin-loop trick, though.  I spin while Yielding() while waiting for disk.

The funny thing is I have just keyboard, mouse, disk, CDROM and VGA and CPUs and PIT and PIC and Internal Speaker.  What's funny is I don't generalize about spinning while Yielding -- I have just those devices and my Disk code happens to work that way, but I don't have a mechanism for other devices because there aren't any other devices.  Actually I spin on locks, so nevermind, I do it in general, but I don't do it on keyboard or mouse.  My CPUs are put in HALT state -- they are not left spinning, except on disk.

Identity-mapping makes interprocess communication trivial.  There is, literally, nothing to it -- you might not know that other operating systems have problems!

I'm not selling it on performance, but on simplicity, which is an odd thing.  The logic is that open source matters to some people because the source code is meant to be looked-at.

I pay a big performance penalty on the stack not being growable in size.  You have to adapt programming to a fixed size stack.  You can't just do recursive algorithms dangerously deep.  I use heap instead of stack which is slower, heap-allocated char buffers are nice for not being fixed size, though, as they would be on stack, so you get some side advantages.

I have almost no arrays (except strings).  I avoid them in favor of dynamic size lists.  My code is simple and elegant.  On normal no-crash systems, you might think no size limits are good.  The problem is on normal no-crash-allowed systems you have to prevent running out of memory.  In my operating system it is awesome because I have no limits and I don't check for running out of memory, so the code is super simple and you almost never have limits.

You are supposed to love God.

You are supposed to praise God.

You are not supposed to covet.

The Church is against money, more or less.

If you are heathen communist atheists, I hardly need to tread lightly.

If you are liberal Catholics, I'm going to gently suggest you do not have an accurate view of happiness.  I could talk about many misconceptions but basically King Midas works.  If you had money, maybe it stops making you happy.

It sounds a little bit tragic if the nation of Cuba gets terrible sorrows with each defector.

I encounter a lot of latins who look at me and think they are just as good if not better.  My personality is I am deceptively easy to misunderestimate.

You can bet a whole bunch of the people who mocked Bush underestimated him.

He does one thing and every kid disrepectfully thinks he's smarter than Bush.

There is this common misconception -- a band like Nirvana comes out.  Soon ten bands are playing the same style.  There are people who do not understand why they are any less clever than Nirvana.  They think the world is unfair because they can play this style of music better than Nirvana.  They bitch about how unfair it is and how record producers are corrupt and Nirvana sold-out. (I don't know what that means but they might say it, LOL.)

What do you say to someone who does not see themselves accurately compared to others?

I suggest you start with God saying the world is more or less just.  Then, work backward.

If someone says the world is not fair for some reason, I guess sometimes the world changes and it gets corrected.  Mostly, you have to assume they are not understanding what they are talking about.
