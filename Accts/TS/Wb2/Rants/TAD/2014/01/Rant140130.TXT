If I says something very clearly it's probably true.  I don't speak sarcastically or aligorically very often.

My files are stored compressed if they end in Z.  You read and write whole files.  The operating system compresses and uncompresses automatically.  It is strictly one file at a time, not clusters of files.

I made compiler.  My documents are ASCII with $$CMD,""$$ with escape codes.  After the text portion of my files is binary data.  The text refers to different numbered binary data items.

All source code is included, including compiler and editor.  It fits in 2 Meg which is shocking to new generation folk, but old people nod knowingly familiar with what can be done in little room.  I save space by having source code alone and not source plus binary. I JIT compile, so I never need binarys mostly.

I have done 20 applications the prove it works.  They span the intended usage for the operating systems.  Hymns are my main thing.

It's really really neat and beautiful -- how divine intellect made it turn-out.  It's a diamond.  Maybe not quite a perfect diamond yet, but when we get the world on-board it will be the Earth's most precious thing, along with a list of God's favorites.  Elephants and bears.

If they did care about what they ate they'd probably starve.  They eat cardboard when you give them a cake treat.

You cannot do anything unless you boot it.  The compiler only works natively.  If it does not boot, you have no way to compile.  To make my compiler work under Linux, I would have convert the entire thing from HolyC to standard C/C++.  It's 20,000 lines of code.  My entire operating system that I wrote is 120,000 lines of code, so 20,000 is sizable but not huge.  The compiler requires 20,000 lines of my library/low level routines.

I would find it depressing wasting all that time programming on Linux.  I only want to program in my own operating system.
