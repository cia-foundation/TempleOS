Our job is to figure-out what God likes.  He likes praise.  Animals are the most obvious thing to praise.  God likes soap operas best on TV.  God said pets were "homo".  Most people probably don't cross the line with pets, but I wouldn't want to give you the impression God condones beastiality.

I have made God's temple.  Here's what I want:

$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Demands"$$FG$

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP"$
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP"$	:1004
$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ $FG,2$.Z$FG$ LZW compression.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.

I didn't need bootloaders.  I figured-out ATA/ATAPI PIO for my regular disk drivers.  When faced with doing BootLoaders, "Well, I know how to do Direct ATA/ATAPI PIO!!!"  That's what I did.  I prompted for IDE Primary/IDE Secondary MASTER/SLAVE.  Then used DX as a base I/O port number, adjusting it up and down.

It became clear, it would be better to do BIOS.  So I did 13/42.  I learned that DL has BIOS drive num from OSDev.

Gee, my first Job was at Ticketmaster in 1990 programming on their VAX operating system.  It had a thousand users on 2 Meg.  I have one user with 8 Gig.  If I were working for Ticketamster making a main frame, I might do paging.  My vision is a Commodore 64, home computer.  It's faster and simpler just identity-mapping 128 Gig and never looking back.

You fucken pathetic niggers.  I was doing paging in 1990.  I fucken wrote a compiler for my operating system.  How dare you talk to me?

You can use 4K or 2Meg page size.

I map 128 Gig using 0x80000 bytes of memory for page tables.  That's it.  I never fuck with page tabels after I set them up.  It never gets a CPU penalty for out-dated page entry.

You can do what you like, but mine is just like I'm not using paging.  I won't mock you for using paging, but I don't want it.  Mine is ten times smaller, simpler and faster.
