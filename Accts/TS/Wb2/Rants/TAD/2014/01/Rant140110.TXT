What if I had as many resources as went into that dam for Your temple, God?  Know what we would do?  We would make Intel chips with MMU-less cores, no paging, just ring0, no SSE MXX and have a shitload.  We would still want to run with Windows or Linux.  Would it save significant silicon or boost performance?  Our goal would be doing graphics on CPU, just for transparency.  I guess the 640x480 screen can only be divide in so many pieces before it gets in each other's way, too much.  

I don't know.  What about Your designs, God?  Oh and we would spend most of the money on fabulous art.  The finest pixel art ever would line the walls.

In other words, it's done, but if we had that many resourses we'd make it even more done.

They don't believe in God and don't like overpopulation.  If I say "God" and you say "Abortion", you are an atheist.

This is simple psychology.  You just don't get the same enthusiasm for "Proabortion".   They clearly do not believe in God.

It's just not gonna happen that a strait male is obsessed with promoting homo rights.  If I say "God" and you say "homo rights", You're a homo and an atheist.

God's fuzzy on homo, but you just do not find radical prohomo in believers.  Believers believe in helping the poor, but there's not a "defend homo rights" passion in believers.

If I say "God" and you say "stem cell research", you are an atheist.

If I say "God" and you say "radical Islam", you're probably an atheist.  An atheist looks at all religions with equal contempt and gives-away a high view, not on the same level.  A Christian has to be a Christian and not "all are equal".  When you get a "all religions are equal" condescention, it's an atheist.

Actually if you don't really believe in miracles, you are really an atheist.   My parents are atheists.  All Catholics are atheists.  The Pope is an atheist.

If God can scream and yell in yer face but you refuse to believe it is Him, you are an atheist.

9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the
Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
there is none like me in all the earth.

9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

the earth.

God said Dickens times were rough.  I think highs and lows balance.  $TX,"Luke 6:20-26",HTML="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:20-26&version=NIV"$.  When I say highs and lows balance, it's not a very satisfying profound phenomina.  Basically, if you have hope for something not obtained, it counts as mood-lifting.  Basically, every day you go throught slight changes in mood and I suggest they balance.  Jesus said if you laugh you will cry;  if you cry you will laugh.  Some people say it is not wise to laugh.  It's a big distraction, but my point is... how do I explain this... just being alive, you will have some mood, mostly blah... you will have highs and you will have lows.  Even if you were in prison, your mood would not be low the whole time.  If we get credit for sadness, I would feel cheated if I were not sad the whole time in prison.   "That's not fair!  I was not sad, so I don't get a reward!"

Wisdom has a certain heft.  You know the feel of wisdom when you smack it against your hand.  Unwisdom looks pathetic.  A Chinese woman fed cow brains to her kids.  LOL  I immediately scorn all my old atheist logic.  The World is perfectly just and any contrary view, I scorn.

This is a pretty good proof of God:

Find a single person who had obvious ecstatic highs in their life and not obvious heart wrenching lows.  Find a single one.  Is that shocking to you atheists, or what!  Proof of God!  In case random numbers aren't good enough.  How could random numbers not be enough?
