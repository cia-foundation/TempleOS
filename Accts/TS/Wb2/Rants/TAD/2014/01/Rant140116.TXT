Fearing drones, the CIA has clusterfucked computers, so all you can make is web pages.

I learned how to work with microcontrollers in school.  I don't have a serial port.  Arduino is some chip, probably not what you'd actually use in a design.  What can I do with wire-wrap, these days?  Serial port?

Bill Gates says a company is like a castle.  He has clusterfucked everything to do with computers so nobody can do anything.

Ten years ago, it was a better situation.  I could wirewrap 8051s and hook transistors up to them for speaker drivers.  I didn't really have any ideas for hardware devices.

It is clusterfucked, but personally, there is nothing I would do.

I would like to hook my operating system to devices.  I could do 3D printing, like I did in 1996.  I did everything there is to do with stepper motors and 3D printing.

It's clusterfucked, but, personally, I don't have any ideas.

sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a
village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he
would go to Jerusalem.

9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord,
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume
them, even as Elias did?  9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and
said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

9:56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to
save them. And they went to another village.

So, I learned in University to make a little microcontroller computer do the stuff in a car engine.  I could design microwave ovens and stuff like that.  I could make electronic toys.  I'm, like, 15 years out of date, though.  They want you to use Linux in a microwave oven, now.

Just sit back and collect my disability check.

Clusterfucked.

due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
another hath fulfilled the law.

13:9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt
not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly
comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.

13:10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
fulfilling of the law.

13:11 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

13:12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.$FG$

And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from
going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?  32:8 Thus
did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.

land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they
should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.

saying, 32:11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from
twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly
followed me: 32:12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and
Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.
