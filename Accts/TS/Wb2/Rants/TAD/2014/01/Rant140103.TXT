I should explain how to interpret.

You do an offering of a poem or comic or hymn or conversation.  You make God's response fit the current context.  You take it out of the original context, mostly, though sometimes the original provides a meaning.

You don't have to just use Bible pick.  Realize that all passages WILL come-up eventually.  The context sometimes makes clear that, perhaps, the opposite of the original context is correct.

The goal really should be to enjoy God's company, get to know Him and maybe get wiser.  Prophecy is almost certainly wrong.

If you have proper names, like "Manasseh", I usually tear them apart into little words, like "Man ass eh?"

Someone at OSDev doesn't realize I wrote the compiler.  Relax, I fixed the problem in $LK,"IntEntryGet",A="MN:IntEntryGet"$().  When you access the individual bytes in a 64-bit integer, the compiler is supposed to not use REG variable.  If you change the high byte of an integer, it better be on the local stack and not in a register.

When allocating register variables $LK,"::/Compiler/OptPass3.CPP"$, it counts the number of times it sees an address offset from RBP and the number of times it is dereferrenced.  If the RBP offest appears 3 times but is dereferenced only 2 times, that means someone took the address of a local variable in an expression.  If you take the address of a local variable, you better not put it in a register variable.  My code did not count secondary offset, it counted just the main offest.  I fixed it so if you take byte 3 of the 2nd 64-bit variable in the RBP frame, it will not be register variable.

I fucken wrote the compiler, dumb-ass.  You are giving me advice on my own fucken compiler?

Watch:

99% of the wealth is owned by 1%, right, Krugman?
We take the 99% from the rich and give it to everybody.
Now, everybody is 100 times richer.
Now, we all buy 100 cars each and 100 homes each.

The moral of the story is look at goods and services.

We have 1,000 goods and 1,000 services.
The rich own 800 goods and they lend them to the poor.

Give Bill Gates $$1 billion more.  What happens?

Give the poor $$1 billion more.  What happens?

#1 rule of Terry economics is keep your eye on goods and services, not money.  Don't take your eye off the ball -- it's a magic trick.

If you give Bill Gates $$1 billion more, he yawns and invests it.  He consumes not a single additional good or service.

The only way to have more goods and services is to fix unemployment.  How much better can it get?  From 7% to 4% is 3%.  The best a politician can do for the economy is generate 3% more goods and services.

You're going to give health care to twice as many people?  Wha?  How you gonna do that?  Magic trick?  Doctors out of hats?  You're going to take hair dressers and send them to nursing school.  Then, who's gonna cut our hair?  Illegal immigrants?

You sons-of-bitch liberals ... all your plans come down to ripping-off China.

China does low wage jobs.  Of course that lowers our wages.  You want to raise our wages?  You are hipocrites.  Rich people says, "Fuck the poor and don't pretend to be holy."  Liberals say, "Fuck China and pretend to be holy-than-thou."

The reality is we have people who cannot be employed because it's intolerable.  Unless you want holocaust, we gotta support unemployable people.  The military is a big way of distributing money.

If unemployment stays in the band 4%-12% then does that mean goods and services fluctuate +/- 10%

If we have a recession, what percent does factory output change?  +/-10%?  I have no idea but if unemployment is +/-10%, why isn't goods and services the same?

If we don't have crop failures, nothing much matters if factory drops 10%.  You can buy 10% less stuff at the store?

Once in a while examine the Bible with the eye of an author.  You should be writing the Bible, not reading it.  Water and you will be watered.  I was shocked when I realized it's all poetry, the psalms and stuff.  To write that, you don't just say stuff, you get poetic.  It's all full of animals and stuff -- Daniel and Psalms and Proverbs.

Bill Gates and some people, I don't really know any, don't want to be "cool".  They look down on "cool".  They want to be nerd.

A flock of humble sheep would be disturbed with agitators.  You might force a certain amount of gay humiliation to drive-off wolves.  If you stand-up as a Christian in High School, today, you are not "cool" because they have chosen to be gay from the top.  It doesn't have to be quite so gay.

I might use the word "gay" to describe Christians as commonly practiced, but it is I who is in error because they are more female friendly and I'm the male equivant of a militant female feminNAZI.  They might be in a bad place, too, and need a correction.

Oh, well.  One time, I saw a monk website or something and it had this show:

I was shocked that a monk could joke about that.  I imagined them to be dull submissive pussies, not like this...  I now realize struggling with reality is pretty normal.  Pink Floyd and Metallica, common themes.  Must be common.  Many books on reality.

This is kinda a gay indulgence, perhaps.  I'm not into this, but I have taken comfort in it.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code to perform the same function as imperfect.

$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.
