What a nightmare -- saving the World.  What if the climate is not a big problem? That's kinda funny if so many are stressing.

Yeah, it sucks if you have to save the World.

Earthquake prediction sounds like fun, but impossible.

I feel like shit -- just uneasy.  Not really tired, but I should be.

Praise You for Yellowstome, God.

You guys see the fireworks when I do a poem of offering?

Buffalo and wolves,
Bears and happy chipmonks,
Water pipes of stoves,
Dead and rotten tree stumps.

Gush a guiser goes.
Ranger scolds a stray punk. 
Flag runs-up a pole.
Cabin with a day bunk.$FG$

$FG,4$6:3 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that
the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good,
and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is
better than he.

6:4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his
name shall be covered with darkness.

6:5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath
more rest than the other.

6:6 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen
no good: do not all go to one place?  6:7 All the labour of man is for
his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.

6:8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
that knoweth to walk before the living?  6:9 Better is the sight of
the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and
vexation of spirit.$FG$

You said magnifying glasses are the best toys to give kids.

I had the idea that zoos might be good -- things whaich cause praise of the Creator.

Solar power is looking good, huh?  Thank You, God, if providence is waiting.  It's very scary, sometimes.

You kinda lose control of what you are saying, if you reach for the sublime when you write poems.  I think it definitely qualifies as tongues, but the Bible says to test spirits.  It says seek to have an abundance.

"Seek to have an abundence of spirits."  If you get a demon, no big deal, don't be a coward.  It happens, LOL.  Excitement!  God sometimes acts weird.  I know what I'm talking about.  God does not allow too much at-easy relaxation.

$FG,4$19:10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the
children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,

seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third

not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet

$FG,2$I think that's about City Slickers, LOL.  I know God.

Yeah, that is also about bad spirits.  It's hard to admit, but in the past, I had some genuinely evil spirits.  That's slightly alarming.  "Oh, great, I was possessed by a demon :-( ."

You have to collect your wits and diagnose yourself.  It takes clear thinking.

If you find yourself sympathetic to Hitler and feeling racist, for example, you might want to sit down and think, "Wait, this is probably evil, huh!"

I've had demons or agents calling me a nigger so much, I use it -- make no mistake, it's a blood sport -- my fight with demons.  It is kinda nice being the one who's not weak, LOL.

One time, many years ago, I found myself writing a poem lapsing into a anti-Muslim Holy War suggestion.  It made no sense for me to say it, it was kinda like showing-off poetic skills, if talking in a voice not your own, acting like a Southern hick, makes sense.  Mark Twain wrote fiction with dialog coming from characters in his book...  What demon possession is, is when a innocent person -- you -- thinks you are being like Mark Twain writing fiction, for absolutely no reason whatsoever -- and how it appears and comes-out is a crazy evil biggot talking... and you are unaware how evil you are!$FG$
