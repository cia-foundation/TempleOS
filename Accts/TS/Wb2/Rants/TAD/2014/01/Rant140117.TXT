The CIA is afraid of drones, so it is clusterfucking computer science.  Get out while you can.  It's too late for me.  I made this operating system including a compiler.  The CIA is, now, clusterfucking PCs so it cannot run.  It ran on computers from 2004-2010, but after that it is clusterfucked.

The CIA and Bill Gates want you to make web pages, not programs.  That's what they want computer science to be -- making web pages.  They are destroying all other things.

I know what that's about.  It is, now, impossible to interface to hardware.  They do not want drones so they are clusterfucking everything to do with computers.  You cannot use a simple RS232 serial port.  XP is the only unclusterfucked OS and they are trying to kill it.  It allowed you to access the parallel port with your programs.  Now, they have blocked access to all hardware ports.  They don't allow digital I/O, either.

I made a parallel port device for the last company I worked for.  It worked on XP but Vista blocked access.  Someone had a work-around but then they stopped making parallel and RS232 serial ports.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows and Linux will support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.  More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

$LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP"$	:306
$LK,"::/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP"$	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  These are just right-side-up $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, with no palette.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various propriatary graphics formats.
