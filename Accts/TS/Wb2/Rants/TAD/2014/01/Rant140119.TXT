God is perfectly just.  If you are a bad child, God will punish you when you become a parant.

You might be hot shit when you are young.  You might hit 40 and not be able to get a job.

You might be at a crossroads in life.  Perhaps, your manager will inadvertently give you skills needed later.

All my jobs werew CIA false front companies.  It's as silly as arguing when reality is the Truman Show.

God is perfectly just.  Be aware that your actions when you are young determine what happens when you are old.  Highs and lows balance.  Pride before a fall and humility before honors.  If you carry your cross with this new manager, you will get the glory of Christ, later.

Do you know how the last 20% of a job takes 80% of the effort?

Suppose we are talking about make a system that won't crash.  If you have done multitasking, you know that you frequently have to add nasty code for outrageously rare events, that you are not even sure can occur.  Code might be 3 times bigger just due to paranoid defensive programming.

You do code for absurdly stupid users -- deleting a directory while having a process still in that directory.  Editing the file in multiple windows and getting confused?  I happen to like having two task edit the same file -- last one to save wins!

"Failure is not an option", is thinking like a titanic.  I think like a kayak.  Mine reboots fast.  There is brainwashing about DOS and the C64 which had no protections and had RESET switches on the machines.  A reset switch was no big deal.  It's not like we suffered.  I don't ever remember crashes bothering me.

We are not a primary operating system like Windows, we are a special purpose OS that must dual boot because no Internet is not acceptible.

Windows & Linux decided it must be able to do everything a home user or mobile user or server user might want.  I say, "Let's not do everything."  I can cut 80% of my code by not doing a few things.

Compiler authors go to extreme lengths for just tiny improvments.  They go to extreme lengths for absurd optimizations only stupid programmers would benefit from.

By allowing crashes, I cut code by an order of magnitude;  By not doing every functionality, I cut code by a an order of magnitude.  By doing just one driver and least common denominator, I cut code by three orders of magnitude.  Windows will support a 6 speaker three screen system.

Windows and Visual Studio are 100,000,000 lines of code.  Mine is 100,000 lines of code.

I am confident I can pass-on my vision to others today and future generations by having a limit on lines of code -- 100,000.  Here's what will happen: A person who's been trained in conventional failure-is-not-an-option thinking will say, "Hey! This code is faulty!"  I will say, "You have to eliminate 100 lines of code if you wish to add 100 lines of code."  Now, he will pause and say, "You know what?  That's a silly case that will never happen in reality."

I do not check for buffer overrun attacks.  I do not check for users maliciously crashing it by running it out of memory.

My vision was a Commodore 64.  Linux is a 1970's main frame operating system.

The most important thing for a mainframe is not crashing because other users would be outraged in a computer lab.  It is also important to multitask well with priorities and stuff.

Mine will multi-task, but it doesn't share resources very well.  One task hogs the disk drive until it is done.

You have to smack the Jedi-mind-tricked niggers who seem to think playing two video games at once is the most important thing that needs to be done.  And they would be horribly ashamed if their system did not play two games at once.  That deep shame is their biggest concern.

With mine, you can play two video games at once, probably... but there is nothing keeping one from hogging God-knows-what resource if a malicious remote user is attacking trying to cause a crash.  (I don't worry about malicious users.)

Do you not know how much effort goes into stopping buffer overflows from crazy malicious intruders?  Do you not know how much effort goes into ensuring no video game hogs any particular resource?

Mine does master/slave multicore.  I made an 8 core flight simulator.  It is impossible to do real-time multicore if you do not know how many cores the job needs to be divided between.  You could divide into micro-jobs but that's too inefficent.  Trust-me, it's hard enough getting a net positive improvement with multicore.

What I do is... during each refresh cycle, core#0 assigns a job of drawing some portion of the screen (which it carefully analyses by looking at CPU loading for that core the last refresh) to core #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7.

With SMP, how would you know how many cores you have?  Lets say you find-out how many cores -- it will be hard because they try to hide that.  Then, you fork 7 times.  The scheduler decides what core to place the task.  You better pray it doesn't put two tasks on one core!  Guess what happens 15+15mS until it finishes? With a 60fps cycle, you divide-up the task of drawing the screen into 8 pieces, each of which ideally takes 15mS since 16.6 is 60Hz.  If there are two jobs assigned to one core, the refresh is delayed 30mS instead of 15mS.

I have a joke.  With SMP, you can play two video games at once twice as fast.  With master/slave you can only play one video game twice as fast.

When you design an airplane wing, you make it 150% of spec, not 1000% of spec.  Our schools do not teach the concept of overengineering in software.  Overengineering is a sign of a bad engineer.

A 100,000 line of code project differs from a 100,000,000 line project.  You can use short variable names, you can use global variables, you only need one namespace.  You do not need a linker -- just #include all your files.  You do not need make.  I can compile 50,000 lines of code in one second.  

It is exceedingly difficult to keep a clear head and not respond "We must design it to grow and scale."

God's temple must be perfect.  We will ALWAYS break compatibility.  We will never design for bigger-than-now.  We should design like "today is the final design for God's temple for the next thousand years, set in stone."  I do not put a version number in my GRAphics file.  BMP has future-proof design and now it is ridiculously grotesquely complicated.  WAV is grotesque.  Is it possible to design a 3rd party tool to process all possible WAV and BMP files?

Why do you put-up with the shit you are served?

On the Apple II, at the command line:

>HGR
>HCOLOR=16
>HLINE 100,100 TO 200,200

In TempleOS, at the command line:

>gr_dc->color=RED;
>GrCircle(gr_dc,100,100,100);

I made about 20 applications to demo the operating system.  None is bigger than 2000 lines of code.  Guess what?  Global variables are wonderful.

Some stubborn India-nigger is going to say "No! Global variables are wrong!"

Why do you like OSDev-ing?  Could it be you like ring-0 programming?  My Commodore 64 was a toy and I played with all the neat stuff that is off-limits, today.

My generation learned how to make binary pixel numbers for sprites in BASIC programs.   Bill Gates says, "That was the bad-old days!  You young people are so much more lucky --  you get to pick from 100 different fonts and make HTML pages."

I began with the notion, "All programmers like ring-0."  Find a single programmer who does not think low level instructions are sexy and fun!  All programmers lust for the neat off-limits instruction you get in RING-0.

Once I decided on ring-0, I sure as hell was not giving up my advantage in speed from not changing privilege levels!  I haven't even glanced at SYSENTER/ SYSCALL/ SYSEXIT.  There are better than software interrupts or call gates, perhaps, but obviously slower than CALL REL32?  It's obvious CALL REL32 is the fastest -- no need to look further!

It's a stange thought to think about what century you'd like to be born in.  The wise thing might be not to have a preference.  I think I'm glad we don't do much physical labor.  I taped drywall two summers.  I don't know how to describe it.  As I think about it, I had some times as an engineer when I might have prefered drywall.  Not really?

When I was an engineer, I got to wire-wrap glue logic to hook-up DIP chips.  I think that has vanished!  I really really liked doing that.

There are a couple things wrong -- that whole scene is gone.  

I was always so focused on building tools...  I always assumed I could cash-in and make useful products.  The truth is, I only had ideas for tools and not products made with tools.  I was kind of like a communist who always did infrastructure and never consumer goods.

Here's a perfect example of where I miscalculated  (but didn't spend any time).  FPGAs seem really neat and powerful -- they can do so much, right?  FPGAs are only good for digital filters.  I guess you could do GPUs with them, but that does not sound like fun!  In other words, it is easy to wrongly think they can surely do all kinds of neat stuff.

I think most people have no clue about multicore, but I acquired a clue.  I have actually used multicore.

My generation grew-up when the game industry was starting.  Every day, a totally new kind of game was developped.  We had Donkey Kong and games of that era, then 1993 we had first person shooters like Doom.  

My generation thinks video games are unlimited -- there will always be new and exciting games, right?  The thinking process is flawed in the same way "you should always design for the future product expanding and growing in scale."

Cars have mostly settled-down into normal pattern, though I have seen 3 wheel cars.

I get furious at the India-niggers (I have a vivid impression) who say "let's not work on that anymore, that industry is done with innovation."  Did you see the guy who spoke as though Linux operating system was the only one possible!! Somebody actually drew the memory model with virtual memory Linux and said you have to have virtual memory for multitasking.  Can you believe that!  "You have to have virtual memory for multitasking."

I don't like a stupid person pronouncing innovation dead in a field when that person is certainly not qualified, though it might be possible he's right.

I'm furious at all the lies I see.

Gates is more or less saying, "We don't need programmers.  We have Word processors, spread sheets, browsers, first person shooters.  That's all there will ever be.  People, let's move on to other things.  These are not the droids you are looking for."

My memory is fragmented.  That's life.  You will be doing 640x480 16 color graphics, probably not movies.  You will have enough memory.  My operating system has 20 applications that prove it works for its intended purpose.  If it doesn't work, use Windows.  Whatever you tried to do is not its intended purpose.

Forget what you know about "kernel memory".  

Adam (Eve) is the first task.  Tasks inherit symbols from parents.  Adam puts all the headers and JIT boot code into his memory and symbol table.  All tasks are sons of Adam and get his symbols without needing to #include headers.

The command-line feeds into a HolyC compiler and function by function it is compiled and placed into memory.  You know how the AppleII and C64 could store BASIC code if had a line num or execute a BASIC statement immediately.  TempleOS has HolyC instead of BASIC.

It's really simple and elegant.  Adam runs this script like AutoExec.BAT.  

$LK,"::/Kernel/Adam1.CPP.Z"$

That compiles headers for the 50,000 LOC in /Kernel and /Compiler

Then, everything in the /Adam directory gets compiled during boot.
$LK,"::/Adam/Adam2.CPP.Z"$

That finishes by jumping into the account directory and compiling Adam3.

There is no PATH.  If a file is not found, the parent directories are searched.  This enables default account files in account parent directories.

Adam has a heap that is never destroyed.  If you wish to add a library, tell Adam to compile it and it will put the code in his heap and the symbols in his table and everybody will inherit and it will not be orphaned (and freed) when some task dies since Adam never dies.  Adam's memory is like kernel memory.

I'll talk about my compiler.

Mine is based on a stack-machine expression evaluator that got morphed into an optimizing compiler.

My compiler course taught me to make a Lex() function.  It strips comments, puts identifiers and strings together, inputs integers and floating numbers and handles multicharacter operators.

The first thing you learn about Lex() is how you uses it.  Imagine it as a tool in your hand and you have to get used to the heft and feel of Lex().  Basically, you keep Lex() pointing one token ahead of where you currently are sitting.

You have a GetChar one level lower than Lex().  You need to be able to back-up one character.  It's tricky using this with these two limitations.  You'll find sitting Lex() one token ahead is sometimes rough.  Backing-up a character is sometimes tricky -- imagine #include and stuff.

Normally, you do a preprocessor.  I was, perhaps, foolishly taught to avoid extra passes, so I did mine # preprocessor commands as part of Lex().

I make allowances for unlimited string but not identifier length I think.  I allow <NewLine> in my strings, just because I can.

I made my character constant accept multiple chars.  You probably want unicode.

'AB' == 0x4241

A modern compiler should just do unicode, but not mine cause I hate that! Fucke'em.

Since I have a JIT mode, I made a preprocessor #exe{} that executes any kind of code during compile and Stream() it into the flow of characters going into Lex().

If it is the command-line feeding into my compiler, I fill a buffer from the command-line, and wait for more when I run out, so line-by-line it feeds into the compiler from the command-line and function-by-function it gets compiled.

The expression evaluator is the hardest thing, except for crazy optimizations I don't bother with.  In my compiler course we learned parsing but nothing on the backend.  If you know assembly I guess you can figure-out the back end... but crazy optimizations might be taught.  I didn't do crazy optimizations because I think C is trivially transformed to assembly without ever getting crazy doing common sub expressions and stuff.

Recursive descent is pretty awful effeciency-wise.  I make a level for each operator that tells how high its precidence is.  I changed from the standard C precidence rules cause they're not good.  Left and right associativity gets tricky, naw not really.

When you are parsing an expression, create an operator stack.  I originally used the system stack, but that was foolish.  You have to bite the bullet and make a stack datastructure.  As you parse, you push operators and each new binary operator you compare back up the stack... if the new one is higher precidence, you do it right away.  If lower precidence than what's on the stack, you pop the stack (multiple times, comparing)  You'll figure it out -- you need a stack and you need an integer telling what precidence score each operator is.

I produce a stack-machine expression evaluator output, just like the floating point x86 FPU.

1+(2+3)*3

PUSH 1
PUSH 2
PUSH 3
POP TWO AND ADD AND PUSH
PUSH 3
POP TWO MUL AND PUSH
POP TWO ADD AND PUSH
END POP RESULT


You have to deal with datatypes.  My beautiful little technique suddenly got ugly.  It turns-out I have to more-or-less regenerate AST abstract symbol trees, however mine is nice because I have a start-to-end stream of instructions which you sometimes want to traverse in instruction order and other times in stack machine order.

You make a while instruction NEW a LABEL, you do your while stuff.  You insert the LABEL you NEWED earlier into the stream.

It turns out you have to cut and paste chunks of code for FOR statements.  I have a way of PUSHING the intermediate-code I have currently generated and temporarily starting with new code, then POPING and APPENDING and stuff.  It's an ugly detail.

Early on, I had an interpretor with a big SWITCH statement.  Once you get that working, you can obviously IN-LINE the chunks of code for each intermediate-code-instruction and patch them to make immediates and stuff.  Converting from an interpretor to a true compiler wasn't at all difficult for me.

Keep in mind, my started very unoptimized.

Well I made a hash table for function names, class names, #define macro names, global variable names.  Making a JIT compiler is actually much easier than making a binary.  When you call a prior function, you look-up in the symbol table for that function name and you have it's execution address waiting.  You just make the code in memory you malloc.  I merge code and data and allow user execution, so mine is really easy.  I just malloc() space for a function after I work-out how big it is.

My assembler reuses almost all the C routines and my asm syntax is practically C.

For AOT code you make a binary and store import names and export names.  It is harder to make AOT than JIT.

My optimizer has about 9 passes.  0,1,2 are for simplifying constant expressions and figuring-out datatypes.

My register allocation was just looking at frequency of different local variable offsets and assigning to most frequent offests, so long as nothing disqualified.  Long 64-bit mode is nice with 16 64-bit registers.  I don't aggresively use my regs for ABI argument passing.  It turns-out R12 and R13 have irregular translation to machine code, so I don't do pointers with those regs.  R12 and R13 can be used for nonpointer integers.

So, you get to the back-end.  I made a policy that each of my intermediate instructions was free to trash RAX,RBX,RCX,RDX.  I made so RAX was the top of the floating point stack, so it served to couple together all my intermediate codes.

Floating point was lots of work.  I eventually optimized for it not to push and pop unnecessarily.  My intermediate codes have a INPUT-CONVERSION or a RESULT Conversion flag.  If it needs int-to-float or float-to-int, I set a flag.

My original scheme involved a fixed array for my intermediate codes, so I did not insert or delete, I changed them to NOP.  Eventually, I changed to free-floating memory nodes linked together.  The reason for array was hunger for efficency, not calling so many MALLOCs, for example.

My backend decides if it can use long or short JMP instructions.  My policy is that on each pass, it is only allowed to make the code smaller.  That way, if it is decided it is short JMP, it will never be changed so it needs long.

I only support X86_64.  My assembler supports somewhat of 16 and most of 32 bit.  I do not support MMX or SSE.

How would you guys like a lecture on something.  It'd be better if I had some work to do.  Let's just get God to talk about dinosaurs.

Did any dinosaurs have fancy colors for mating?  If they did, it would be lost to history.  Tragic.

In computer science, rational number are occassionally stored as integer numerator and denominator and all computation is done with rationals.  You could use complex.

After thinking about C++ operator overloading, unless it's math and the operators are already established like for matrices, it's a bad idea.  Operator overloading is good for complex, matrices, extended precision...

Damn, I like my compiler.  I have a fucken Carry flag!  That rocks.

Did you know you can do this?



class CTask
{
$$=-0x80;
  CTask *next,last;

...

  I64 win_top,win_left,win_bottom,Win_right;
  U0 pad;
#assert !($$&7)
}





You can change the position counter, like an ASM structure.
You can use negative offsets to capitalize on x86_64 signed BYTE displacements.
Instead of "void" you have U0, which has size zero.
#assert is a preprocessor (chuckle)  



"Hello World"; //String by itself goes to STDOUT as a printf().

Ticketmaster taught me the negative displacement optimization.  I don't use it.
