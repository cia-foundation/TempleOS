$WW,1$If you insist on doing $FG,2$AOT$FG$ compiled, old school, programs instead of  just-in-time compiled programs, this directory tree has some examples.  The main reason to do $FG,2$AOT$FG$ programs is to make closed-source applications.  Why not do it like the programs in $FG,2$/TempleOS/Apps$FG$ instead?

See $LK,"Scoping and Linkages","FI:::/TempleOS/Doc/ImportExports.TXT"$ for details on $FG,2$extern$FG$, $FG,2$import$FG$, $FG,2$_extern$FG$, $FG,2$_import$FG$, etc.

$FG,5$Demo1$FG$ shows a multiple file AOT module.
$FG,4$

$FG,5$Demo2$FG$ shows a multiple module project.  If you $FG,2$#include $FG$the $FG,4$MakeFile$FG$ you'll see a clear example of how syms are exported and imported by modules and bound to syms in task's hash tables.
