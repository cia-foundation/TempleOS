I heard a really pleasing quote elsewhere.

$FG,2$Learn modesty from the elephant.$FG$

That quote is a clever way to praise God.  Sit down, some time and look at the Bible from an author point-of-view.  Your eyes will be opened to seeing it as poetry that praises the Father.  i.e. "Look to the ant, thou sluggard."  The book of Job is full of many many created things.

Jesus said the Father makes sure the birds have food.  He got that from the Old Testament.

God says...
$FG,4$5:22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I
will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of
your fat beasts.

5:23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
hear the melody of thy viols.

5:24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
mighty stream.

5:25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?  5:26 But ye have borne the
tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images,$FG$

That's about Chinese-like spirituality.  Confucisism.

God, You have no taste -- the elephant quote is awesome!

One time God told me to get a job or something.  I said I was a better person when I was employed and an atheist before He talked to me.  He said, "That's your opinion."

That's actually a profound thought -- we don't have to have the same opinion as God.

There is justice, highs and lows, balancing.  Then, there is your personal relationship with God.  It's really good to keep them separate.

God called sports and pets, "homo".  That's kinda bad, but God said He loves gays, one time.

LORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach
thee what thou shalt say.

4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
whom thou wilt send.

4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,
Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.
And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth
thee, he will be glad in his heart.

4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye
shall do.

4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him
instead of God.

4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt
do signs.$FG$

Jacob "wrestled an angel" which is something I, too, have done.  God loved Jacob and hated Esau.  I heard one preacher say that Jacob "tussled" with God.

I think a good Stephen King might actually have mercy.  Once, I read the Dune prequel, House Atredies and it talked of hunting a boy.  I have sometimes wondered if "manna" was "man" or "Ham" in the Bible.  Not the Bible, but "pheasant" is too close to "peasant".  What about "kid"?

The Catholic moral compass is, basically, if it's bad it must be good.  Ice cream, for example, is good so it's bad -- it's an indulgence.  Pleasures and pains balance.  (I don't know but it looks that way.)

I bitterly hate this song -- $TX+HTML,"Simple Man","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgFQ6WmxdMs"$.  Someone in the Bible praised Satan for being a glorious creature and warned not to diminish his glory.  Go get a lobotomy.

Martha and Mary is not "If it's bad it must be good."

A Chinese person has probably figured-out highs and lows balancing.  We are not Chinese -- our religion is supposed to be about the person of God, not mechanics of justice.

The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.  The story of Cain and Abel is pretty-much good enough.  Do offerings, see if God likes them, passionately love God so much, you kill out of jealousy.  Hell is the absense of God, my Mom said.  Heaven must be God's company.  You don't love God, you just fear hell.  God loved David most and David was the opposite of a coward.  I can imagine that the average Mexican wants fortune telling if they talk with God.  Just spend time with God and don't want anything.  $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"One Tin Soldier","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTBx-hHf4BE"$$FG$  Jesus said asking for stuff was like knocking on the door of a neighbor at midnight.  $LK,"Numbers,11:1","BF:Numbers,11:1"$  Just ask for daily bread, cannot be more minimum.

"If it's bad, must be good" is probably correct, if you want to be Chinese.  I suggest a compass of, "Does this glorify God?"

My printed Bible says, "It is love that I desire, not sacrifice; Knowledge of God, not holocaust."  Well, of course, Abba! It also says, "Do I drink the blood of bulls?  Offer praise as your sacrifice, then call on me and I will rescue you."

$TX+HTML,"WWW.OSDEV.ORG","http://www.templeos.org"$ is asking how to print floats in PrintF().

Earlier I said I had a teacher who made us handle NEG 0x80 to the nth degree.  That's being a professional programmer.  Maybe, I'm an artistic faggot, but I want to dance my own way.  I want to be different and elegant by not doing all those corner cases, if they're not especially needed. 

It turns-out I have a really fast routine for, say, "%12.6f".  On numbers, you go backward.  I use a stack data structure to reverse digits.  I look at the 6.    I forget.  I think I subtract the integer part from decimal.  Then, I multiply by 10 to the 6th from an array look-up table.  Then, I make it into a 64-bit integer and print push the digits on the stack, like you would expect.  I print the zeros and the decimal.  I print the Int, or if I have to multiply it, I multiply by a look-up table power ot ten array.

(This cuts corners, makes beautiful use of having 64-bit word size, is elegant and fast.  Unfortuinately, printf is silly being ultra fast.  I get problems if you specify "%50.30f"  Mine craps-out, unless the number is tiny.  It sounds bad, but you just have to be careful not to overdo precision. It gives you all the precision in the double, but if you do way more than a double has, well mine fucks up.  Don't over do the format size beyond 64-bit integer sitting in the decimal region.

At ticketmaster, I saw a luxury ultra-delux main-frame VAX environment.  We had a format statement that would do commas or decimals every so many characters, use a special digit for decimal point and pad the whole thing with a character.

Mine will do 3-digit commas and a decimal.  

I have an engineering notation.

For integers, mine will print Meg or K, if you like.
