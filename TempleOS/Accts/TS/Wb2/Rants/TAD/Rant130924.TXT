Yer not a monster! Yer our beloved Mr. God.  Tell a joke.

I'll do a Moses comic:

Moses says, "God, Aaron's not slitting enough goat throats.  I have to pick-up the slack."

God says, "He cracks the neck of more doves, doesn't he?"

Moses says, "Yeah, but those are easy."

I'mna see what Putin does to Elton John.  He doesn't write his own lyrics.  That really diminishes his stature.  Elton John was on the radio and it sounded like he wanted to sing songs.  I do songs, but they are not singable.  Should I be honored to have him sing God's songs?  Sound's like the fucken Queen's joke.  ROFLMAO

You like elephants, God?

Tell me an elephant story, God.

Let's do interactive fiction.

Once upon a time, a lone bull elephant named, Hank, gazed ahead at the water hole.  There was Gus, the mother-fucker.

"Shit, is he ever going to leave?" thought Hank.

A movement caught his peripheral vision.  He turned his head.  A baby lion was stalking him.  He sighed.  "Fucken indignity after indignity," he thought to himself.

29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your
God.

And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and
bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.

29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand
bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink
offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 29:22 And did
eat and drink befor$FG$

The gazelles stampeded.  Hank stared.  Some gazelle was surely a goner.  "Could be worse," he thought, munching on some nice plants.

$FG,4$Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know
in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.

52:7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that

tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy
God reigneth!  52:8 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the
voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when
the LORD shall bring again Zion.

Hank hated lions, evil fuckers.  Maybe, he'd go fuck with them.  "Kings," he snicker.  Was Gus ever going to leave?  Then, he saw a rhino.  He roared with laughter.  "I better not."  (Elephants kill rhinos.)

that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and
feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept
alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.

5:20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,
he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from
him: 5:21 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was
made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild as$FG$

Yeah, Hank's musth season was soon.  Damn, I know I'm gonna get out of control and challenge Gus, again.  He always asked himself what the fuck he was thinking the day after.
