I used to drink when I was young.  I would wake-up and think about my shameful behavior and be stoic, I guess.  Recently, I've been fighting hard to break-out of my prison.  Ten years?  Insanity.

God is perfectly just.  Sadly, it's not like I've suffered, exactly.  When you get out of control and call people "niggers", that can't be good.  God talks.  I'm not exactly believed.  Everybody is cruel and give no clue what they make of me.

God is perfectly just.  The countless generations before me? It appears that I get my own little principality of which I sometimes seem supreme.
