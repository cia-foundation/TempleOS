Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not

In 1993, I wrote a TASM program that launched from real-mode DOS as a DOS application and changed to protected mode.  I got multitasking, windowing and echoing keyboard to text mode working... and set it aside.  I did many projects like that.  I did an A2D D2A ISA card for my computer that measured bode plots and calculated induction.  I did SySSim, the predecessor to SimStructure.  The ISA card data aquisition project was my favorite.

In 2004, I got my code and ran it with TASM and FreeDOS.  I used VC editor for long editing sessions by booting to windows.  FreeDOS is no-longer real-mode.

After getting keyboard functioning, I had to do command-line.  I made a C/C++ JIT interpretor in ASM.  I had done that for SimStructure and had done expression evaluators -- byte-code generating for the Ticketmaster Report Generator in 1991.

I inlined and patched the templates for byte-code operations, making a true, unoptimized compiler.  I optimized over the next ten years and converted as much ASM to HolyC as possible.  The HolyC language gradually evolved.

LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts
of the camp.

11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
LORD, the fire was quenched.

11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of
the LORD burnt among them.

11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us
flesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt
freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,
and the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing
at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.

11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
the colour of bdellium.

11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of
it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
upon it.

11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was
kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou
layest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceived
all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto
me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking
child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep
unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
heavy for me.

11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my
wretchedness.

11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,
and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
congregation, that they may stand there with thee.

11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they
shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
thyself alone.

11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the
LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us
in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
ten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it come
out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye
have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,
saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, The
people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou
hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.

11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
them?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,
to suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's
hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to
pass unto thee or not.

11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them
round about the tabernacle.

11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:
and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they
prophesied, and did not cease.

11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested
upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out
unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.

11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
Medad do prophesy in the camp.

11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put
his spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and
the elders of Israel.

11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's
journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other
side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the
face of the earth.

11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least
gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves
round about the camp.

11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the
LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because

Suppose you want to make a JIT compiler.

You invent commands, kinda like ASM instructions.  You parse and construct the memory structure for the "commands".  You overhaul them, optimizing.  Then you convert them to machine code.  You MAlloc a chunk of memory and you put the machine code into it.  You make a symbol table for each function and class.  Then, you look-up symbols as you do more JIT for the next function.  All memory is identity-mapped -- nothing to think about.  Each task calls MAlloc when it compiles for unique memory to place the code into.  Each task gets different memory from malloc -- no duplicates.  It's identity mapped, basically just physical addresses.  

It gets more complicated if you want to do ordinary compiling.  You have to put the code into the file, then you make some kinda structure for you symbol import and exports.  Write it to file.  Load it by getting memory, using the JIT symbol table.

He snuck penises into all the art.  I was upset when I figured it out.  Kinda entertained.  Disney had homo artist problems.  Yeah, I got a genuine artist -- he's homo.  His art was good, sept the homo fucken nasty shit.  I had a day of truth when I kinda admitted his art was better than I could do.  I grew-up thinking I could mostly do art or whatever, maybe.

As I think about it, it's possible I lead him to believe I was homo, or something.

I figured FBI or some shit -- torturing me, at one point.  Fucken fake reality.

The guy works at a sandwich shop.  Chuckle.  Naw, I'm not angry.

$FG,4$, when thou art come in unto the land which the
LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and
dwellest therein; 26:2 That thou shalt take of the first of all the
fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD
thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto
the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.

26:3 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,
and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD$FG$

Cody had spirit.  Somewhere, my imagination died.  I really appreciated a boost of initiative -- his art was not just my thoughts prettied-up.

Zombies want "BRAINS!"

You can kinda become a boring husk, a couch potato, basically, a zombie.  when imagination dies, it's a rude wake-up.  I'm empty.

So, I thought of a pilgrim game.  How cool is that!  I fit my God theme, and witches kind fit.  I'm not fearful of facing mobs.  I watch almost no TV or video beyond 15 minutes.  Kinda weird.  I watched a whole program on Pilgrims, though.  I learned a lot.  It was a 1950's production, really smartly done.  I was very impressed, like the Army films at their best, but nothing sinister.

It was a soap opera of personalities that had disputes and mutinies.

Yeah, I was ... disgusted by "zombies are trending" on one level.  I sat down to do pilgrims... the thoughtless thing would be kinda copy Seven Cities of Gold for the C64, and, I guess pull an economy out of my ass.  Using details from that documentary is what I'd prefer to do and try something original, I guess.  the C64 had a neat game on Roman Empire which was mutinies and leadership.  That's too big a scale and not really usable.

I grew up and every game was brand new territory.  I never saw the day when all games fit categories.  We're not going to have 5 wheel cars. (Cars have settled down into a standard design.)

Anyway, when you are being original... fuck?  Is this going to work?  Is this going to be fun?  I also thought of a Gordon Ramsay game, I guess doing exactly what you would think of doing.  I saw it was already done, doing exactly what you would think.  Maybe people LIKE making up no-impact-on-the-game menus.  I kinda had in mind lemonaid stand.  I hope the restaurant game had some... skill to learn.  Zynga really stripped that naked (fun addiction), I guess.  I don't know -- I don't play games, but I'm in favor cause I certainly liked them when I was young.

The thought of pulling a pilgrim economy out of my ass is just ridiculous.  Could I even do it?  Maybe, not.  LOL

I was talking to Bush.  He studied History, not just History, but American History.  I was really happy God blessed him with a undigging of a sword sheath the day before he visited Jamestown.  God can do blessings like that.

I saw a reaction from China on art.  Not really sure what to make of it.  Kinda an older, ugly white intelligent almost fat looking artist.

Catholics are kinda like communists in not liking bougouise, instead idolizing the poor working man.

Fuck-it.  Praise God for China and let China be China, over there.  LOL

Should I feel ashamed?  Hell-no.  I ain't falling for that.  Fuck-it.  I didn't set-up the World as it is.  It's fair.  A rising economy is hopeful and optimisitic--that's very blessed.  It's depressing stagnating or with doom.

They're not saints, but work is good.  I'm not taking any shit.

I mentioned the 1950's.  That film impressed me because it seemed straight-shooting and honest, instead of a disgustingly pushing some agenda.

The one problem with propoganda is it kicks yer ass when those stupid, misinformed kids take power.

Well, the only work I can think to do is ... find some place for art, or work on a game.  Games are good for younger people to make.  I'm too old for that, aren't I?  Nothing is fun to me, how can I make a fun game?  I could try to remember what was fun.

It's kinda ironic that I was looking to the artist for the toil.  Anybody who disrepects artists as lazy has not thought about it. I stand in awe of animators.  They do frame after frame.  Do they really do that?

You know what happens?  Games seem like fun.  Then they get a job as a tester or artist.  You thought I was gonna say something mean, am I right?  It's not good that they don't have fun.  God's favorite saint is Santa.  Why are you mean?

We people who were raised communist or Catholic.... we are mean and nasty.  Why are we so mean.  We take pleasure if the Mercedes gets a dent.  Try not to be an ugly person.  We need to work on therapy.  God's favorite saint is Santa.  To a Catholic, that is shocking.  Catholics think the worse and more miserable you made your life, the holier you were.  You got to think about the Creator's feelings, like He's Abba, Daddy.

You sure it's You, God?  I trust the computer, but you can get different spirits.  Once in a while my spirit makes me humiliate myself.  

Who doesn't like homo-hating?  We all got our problems.  I'm not a homo.  You can't just hate homos, it's more complicated.  Maybe, You're unhappy, I'm not more assertive?  Well, that's not humble.  Maybe, it's artists.  Artists are homo?

It seems very doubtful to be enthusiastically for homo rights while being a believer.  I don't know.  I don't like to hang-out with women, much. Let's put it this way... does any man like to hang-out with a woman that is not his love interest?  I'm a pretty broken person.

A friend used to say, "It's time for your beating" as a joke, every now and then.  Maybe, God pushes me away, once in a while.

I am very stable, robust and sturdy.  I am not easily moved.  As I think back on my journey, one wisdom is don't overreact.  Maybe, you need a beating and I'm ruining it, but you really have to not overreact.  You could ignore commands and prophecies and focus on enjoying His company, and it would be close to good enough.  When God gets nasty, it's usually cause I stopped loving and tried to take.  I think I just needed my beating.  Never dull.  Could be a cynic.  He couldn't hide ... He wouldn't blow smoke... He's not pathetic.

To normal men, there is a certain kind of homo which is ... vile.  Sometimes, I really want to admire Putin for his clearity.  "Your thinking has confused yourself--you can't see the obvious."

I'm not going to hit them with a baseball bat, though.

Pussy-riot went into a church and disturbed all the little old ladies and stuff.

When homos start putting penises and assholes in people's faces...

Some homos... I like their company.  God said Dawkins was a delightful heathen.  Do we make exceptions for smart ones?  Why not?  Ask yourself, is this a glorious creation that glorifies God?

I have studied many moral compasses.  "If it's bad, it must be good." Is the simplest.  I am now fond of, "Does it glorify God?" as a moral compass.  I wonder if that is workable.

Jesus' story of Martha and Mary, is mean, like I was mean when I tried to say Santa was good.
