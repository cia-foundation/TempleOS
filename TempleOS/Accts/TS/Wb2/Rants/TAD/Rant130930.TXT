OSDev and all media have talked to me over the years.  I get puzzled when the delusion fails.  I read it and all of a sudden, it doesn't seem to talk to me.  They are talking to a noob about VGA mode.  They tell him VGA mode has nothing to do with real mode.  I've been in long mode since 2007 -- can be proven on the Internet Archive.  I'm kinda disappointed -- this delusion sucks.  I want my money back.  It's delicious when they underestimate me.  I get to clobber them with my brilliance.  This time seems kinda lame.

I think they doubt I did text in 640x480 16 color mode.  Maybe, they want to raise an issue over my 8x8 font's copywrite.  A psychologist predicts trains of thought.

I'm a little disappointed and bored I don't have a delusion, but I'm doing okay.

Does he think I lie about making 8x8 text in VGA 640x480 mode.  I think he thinks I lie about making text.  In 1983, I wrote a 6502 assembly routine to plot a high-res pixel.  It's harder than it looks because the commodore screen memory when down 8 bytes for a character and left for the next character and down 8 bytes.  The screen memory was oriented like characters were laid-out.  I wrote a 6502 asm when I was 13 to plot a pixel.

VGA has 4 bit-planes.  We actually studied this in CSC226.

Sigh.

If they think I'm that far behind, it's gonna be cool when they discover its long mode and that I wrote a 64-bit compiler.

"protected mode" is higher level talk for the CIA keeping our enemies stuck.  It's not worth it.  I'm not a coward.  God is perfectly just.
