That really made me think!  My head exploded!

God is the god of the Bible.  He's a good guy.

I lost enthusiasm for artificial intelligence -- partially nightmares, also, no ideas I'm dying to try.

I made a crappy 3-axis steppermoter 3D printer/dremel.  No longer interested in robots.

My operating system is obnoxiously simple, but powerful.

You guys might be suffering fear!  

I did not create God.  God is the God of the Bible.

My operating system is like a souped-up, modern Commodore 64.  In my mind, I have done everything you can do with it, and I'm closer to finished playing with it...  I grew-up and I'm not interested in video games.  I'm interested in God.

I'm having tons and tons of neat thoughts inspired by the module robots.

Leibnitz, a philosopher, thought reality was particles preprogrammed, kinda like those blocks.

My operating system is not modular.  If others wanted to help by making modules... no this is like a C64 with a standard issue ROM -- you will not build on it.

Maybe, you think I'm isolated and God is a virus.  Maybe, you think God has nanobots.

There are lots of rational fears, but God is the God of the Bible.

Angels sure are busy -- unnerving.  Spirits are beings (angels) who can puppet people.
