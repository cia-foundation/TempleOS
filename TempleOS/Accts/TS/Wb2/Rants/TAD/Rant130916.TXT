One time, Mom wanted me to go venerate the Eucharist.  They think God is in the bread and they keep Him company.  Jesus said, "Where two or more are gathered, I'm in your midst."  So, I said to Mom, "What do we need to go over there for?"  Perhaps, the Eucharist is a dead chunk of flesh and a live spirit is present when you talk to each other.  Spirits do make you say stuff.  You can hear spirits in yourself and others when you talk.
