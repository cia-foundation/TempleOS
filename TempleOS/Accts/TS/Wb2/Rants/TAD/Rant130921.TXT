I took two philosophy courses, as a minor in my undergrad.  At the time, I was an atheist and I was furious that my "modern philosophy" course was so backward -- 1700's and 1800's.  Then, I took "philosophy of science" and I absolutely hated Karl Popper.

Philosophers are divided into Materialists, Idealists and Dualists.  At the time, I was a Materialist and could not figure-out what the fuss was.  After going crazy (being born again) and discovering that there is a delusional (spiritual) realm, now, I understand.  The movie, American Beauty, shows a scene where a drug deal is happening, but from an observer's perspective, it looks like a homosexual act.

I chuckle at people arguing over what God says in tongues.  Much of it is noise.  It's funny that in $LK,"Acts,2:1","BF:Acts,2:1"$, they don't bother to record any of what the spirit said.  $LK,"Daniel,5:1","BF:Daniel,5:1"$ shows tongues -- it's mean to tickle/to-kill a person or the president.  In $LK,"1 Corinthians,14:1","BF:1 Corinthians,14:1"$ they say only five words in ten-thousand makes sense.

There were about two years I chose not to eat meat, 2004-2007.  The BBC and other media would have psy-ops (demons) giving me nightmares and I learn I could avoid nightmares by not eating meat.  Also, I smoked cigarettes and I could retort to anybody, "I don't eat meat, do you want me to tell you not to eat meat?  Shut-up about smoking, then."

36:4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote
from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had
spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

36:5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go
into the house of the LORD: 36:6 Therefore go thou, and read in the
roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in

did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

south side southward: 36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made under
the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

Things I'm having trouble with?

It's done.  I've capped the line count at 100,000 and we are at 98,000.  To get a sense of how it might work, perhaps you install fresh and run applications, like a game on a C64.  In other words, if you can install in under 5 minutes, and there are no 3rd party libraries, it operates like a C64.  You don't have to reinstall all the time, but lets assume that's easy and normal.

It's God's temple.  It must be perfect.  How about we just ship entire installs on 3rd party apps to future proof -- just bring the 5Meg operating system with you when you make an application.  Only problem is saved games and stuff.

I would love it if Intel burned it in their chips -- God's temple, after-all.

I want art, like the Sistene Chapel.  I guess I accept code improvements, but we keep the 100,000 line cap.

VMware needs to emulate a PC Speaker, or put back support for PC speaker (that they fucken removed).

VMware should enable ATAPI PIO CD-ROM burning.

All PCs BIOSes should set-up ATA/ATAPI PIO for hard drives/CDROMS.

Fuck UEFI.

We stick to PS/2 keyboard/mice.  BIOSes should not disable mouse.

Fuck SecureBoot.  It's gone.  Ask God.

Windows and Linux need to support Red Sea files system on hard disk and CDROM.  Then, we can remove support for FAT32 and ISO9660 from God's beautiful, perfect, temple, saving many lines of code.

So, if you have code imporvements, send me an email  tdavis@templeos.org.  It's sad --  at this point 100% is written by me (some art from Code Rigby that I paid $$3,000 for).  <Chuckle>  No amateur programmers have contributed to this.  I was a paid professional operating system developer on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system in 1990 at age 20.  Denny did our PASCAL compiler; Troy did our linker & assembler.

Assembly language is easier to learn and can do more with more flexibly.  You can do negative and positive structure offsets, for example.

Minimal abstraction is easier to understand.  But difficult to read and write code.  You could teach asm to anyone in about 2 years of instruction.  They would have complete understanding of computers -- it would be a matter of working-out the details.

Do you know how algebra is tedious, but in theory everybody understands?  Assembly could be learned by everyone, but be tedious.

Anyway, I made God's temple with minimal abstraction as a goal.  Not assembly, though.

Everybody knows that scaling is a problem.  When you go to 100,000,000 lines of code, it gets difficult.  Guess what?  When you shrink to 100,000 lines of code it reverse scales!  You don't need a linker or make, just compile everything!  You don't need name spaces!  You don't need long names.

My vision is a C64, not a main frame.

Since it will always be 640x480 16 color due to God's commandment, you might not buy software for it.  Why would you buy a 640x480 game when you could use Windows for a high res games?

The assumption is that an operating system must do everything you might want.  Not for us!  Just use Windows.  At the time of the C64, there were main frames.  They did not attempt to do enterprise techniques on a C64.  It was a fucken home computer.

10:15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion
of the body of Christ?  10:17 For we being many are one bread, and one
body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.

10:18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
sacrifices partakers of the altar?  10:19 What say I then? that the
idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is
any thing?  10:20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles
sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not
that ye should have fellowship with devils.

10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.

So, blasphemy was when Jesus said He was God.

So, blaspheming the Holy Spirit, to me, means saying the Holy Spirit said something it didn't say and Jesus said that was, practically, the only unforgivable sin.  As long as you do a good-faith interpretation, I'm okay, but if somebody says God says something He didn't say, that should be a captital offense.

One interpretation is arguing or contradicting what the Holy Spirit said is unforgivable.

Shit, God, bleak.

$FG,4$ck.

11:4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
thereby.

11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

11:6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days
still in the same place where he was.

11:7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
again.

11:8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
stone thee; and goest thou thither again?  11:9 J$FG$

God says...

be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt
offer salt.

2:14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green
ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.

2:15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it
is a meat offering.

2:16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten
corn thereof, and part of the o$FG$
