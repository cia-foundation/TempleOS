* Bug? Hung after pressing CmpMain in personal menu.  Haven't seen in a while.
* Crashes after back-up-script.  Went away maybe after spurious IRQ fix.
* Music organ hangs when cursoring around.  Haven't seen in while.

* $LK,"DocUpdateTaskDocs","MN:DocUpdateTaskDocs"$() used to skips locked docs. $LK,"WinMgrSync","MN:WinMgrSync"$() needs to check?

* Why was wordstat so slow on "OldMasterBootWrite" for example.

* $LK,"Plain","MN:Plain"$() might be better not saving $LK,"CH_CURSOR","MN:CH_CURSOR"$.

* TRANSPARENT might not work with line ROPF_DITHER

* It would be nice if $LK,"U","MN:U"$() NOP were better.

* Autoindent is very bad.

extern of fun with dft arg of str?

* We kinda need a routine to return how much free memory, so that applications can plan a big alloc.

* FileMgr bad with lots of files.  

* This $LK,"Fs->catch_except=TRUE","FF:::/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP,Fs->catch_except=TRUE"$ causes problems because it catches divide and out-of-mem.  Not sure what to do, yet.
* $LK,"MPStart","MN:MPStart"$() free old task memory. (Prolly never gonna do anything about this.)
* $LK,"sys_var_init_flag","MN:sys_var_init_flag"$ local vars.
* sprite shift pts, ctrl pt for ellipse/polygon w,h is off when rotated.

* Window mgr needs to do DOC operations on posted messages from mouse.  Works for $LK,"SetIP","MN:SetIP"$(), though.

* Add local vars to sym table in $LK,"Dbg","MN:Dbg"$()?  (maybe)

* Syncronize VGA memory update with the hardware refresh cycle.

* Demo $LK,"ToHtml","MN:ToHtml"$().

* Del short name in FAT32--currently I do not check to see if I have generated a unique short name and one can delete multiple files accidentally.  Generating unique short names is a pain in the ass because you have to scan the whole directory.  I think I just truncate the name instead of "Program~1" or whatever. S081130-0001.BMP crashed windows--two identical short names.

* OVERSTRIKE at cmd line with menu macro.

* $FG,2$lock{}$FG$ warning on invalid modes.
* Local array vars-->reg.
* $LK,"DCF_SYMMETRY","MN:DCF_SYMMETRY"$, before transformation? (Currently it's after)

* preempt(OFF) during graphic clipping?
* compiler optimization heap_glbls with added offset
* AOT-compile extern glblvar references. 
* extern glbl var in AOT module on data heap.
* Might make FAT32 read in contiguous chunks.
* make Limit(),Min(),Max() asm routines.
* Might make CSprite flood fill operate on a separate bitmap and blotted at the end.
* autofile popup of popup
* <CTRL-R> delete subsprite in menu near others
* consider changing domenu so a real <ESC> on menu item doesn't select (<SPACE BAR> sends <ESC> followed by <SPACE BAR> or something)
* puts3 with depth buf?  might not do this
* make task queins and querem safe for multicore cycling through tasks (fwd).
* make better heapwalk, do something with _CFG_HEAP_DBG.
* log to file--would be inefficient--load-in whole file, modify and write out.  Useful, but not very efficient  (TempleOS file system has no grow-file ability.  Created when FAT patent was an issue and wanted absly nothing people could sue me for.)
* APIC2
* import intel datasheets, somehow?
* Might make DskView show drive colors.
* Might do utility to set drive colors, making a tree entry in Adam 3 using registry-like routines... or registry I guess.

* New Editor widgets

* Make use of flag potential in SysFilesFind and possibly CFileAccess
* implement fixed pos files

* new C+ language features
* better debugging

* Change hardcoded stuff to Define
* Too much preemption turned off?
* Look for mem leaks.
* Move stuff out of Kernel module.

* $LK,"ROP_XOR","MN:ROP_XOR"$ with pen_width>1 is broken.

* use width and height in line clipping for pen_width>1 or blot.
* SIMD transformation
* test removable media id  (critical for resident files)

* add field overflow U8 "t='*'"
* Implement fmt codes into GetF
* GetF date codes and maybe $FG,2$h$FG$ fmts for nums
* Date Input
* Default date fmt

* 16 bit Unassembly is bad--very low priority
* more signed int disassembly
* support r4u8 by adding 0x40 byte
* static var off of data heap.
* Might want to use U32*U32 multiplication.
* could add "const" to not set LF_NOT_CONSTANT flag for trig, etc.
* do r,rm ICCmp like ICBrCmp
* could make glblvar imports use TY_RIP_DISP32.
* PUSH_CMP allocs reg R9 or whatever
* Might be problem with NOP in OPT pass1 for NO_PUSH in expressions besides assignments.  Is ShiftNoPush fully implemented?
* NOP1 might need to have diff ic_data's
* in divequal, it assumes about ebx
* error/warning line nums
* ASM branch out warning of range off by 1 line--use lx->last_line_num

* Switch statement with sparse cases (low priority)
* maybe inline functions?
* Use of more floating-point stk?

* More aggressive in this routine $LK,"CmpF2PushPop","MN:CmpF2PushPop"$() with types besides MOV and F64. 
* !dbl ~dbl
* &=, |= can overflow with Bts Btr on small data types

* num lock comes on with break key
* sort options for findfiles
* recalc_start could be more accurate before recalculating?
* Maybe, get rid of $LK,"0x20000","FF:::/TempleOS/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP,0x20000"$ in compiler.
