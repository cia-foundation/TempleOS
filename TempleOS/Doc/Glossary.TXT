$ID,-2$$TR,"Task/Process/Thread"$
$ID,2$There is no distinction between "task", "process" or "thread."  The $FG,2$Fs$FG$ segment register is kept pointing to the current task's $LK,"CTask","MN:CTask"$.  There is only one window per task.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Adam Task"$
$ID,2$This is Adam, as in Adam and Eve, the parent of all tasks.  This task is created at start-up and appears in the small window at the top beneath the user windows.  On it's heap are all memory objects which are system wide.  When created, it runs the file $LK-A,"::/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1.CPP"$  Normally, Adam1.CPP.Z ends by $FG,2$#include$FG$ $LK-A,"::/TempleOS/Adam/Adam2.CPP"$ where the remainder of the operating system is "$FG,2$#include$FG$d".  When start-up is finished, the adam task enters a server mode where it accepts requests from other tasks.  The $LK,"Adam","MN:Adam"$("") routine will cause the adam task to compile and run text src code.  "$FG,2$#include$FG$" statements can be sent to the $LK,"Adam","MN:Adam"$("") routine, creating system-wide code and data which don't disappear when any particular task ends.  (The Adam task is immortal.)

$ID,-2$$TR,"Seth Task"$
$ID,2$This is Seth, as in Adam and Eve's child.  Each CPU core has a special task which is immortal and which is special.  The Adam task on CPU#0 is also it's Seth task.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Code and Data Heaps"$
$ID,2$TempleOS uses the asm $FG,2$CALL$FG$ instruction exclusively and it's limited to calling routines +/-2 Gig from the current code location.  To prevent out-of-range issues, I decided to separate code and data, placing all code within the lowest 2 Gig of memory.  The compiler and $LK,"Load","MN:Load"$()er allocate memory from the code heap to store code and glbl vars, unless the compiler option $LK,"OPTf_GLBLS_ON_DATA_HEAP","MN:OPTf_GLBLS_ON_DATA_HEAP"$ is used.  When programs call $LK,"MAlloc","MN:MAlloc"$() is comes from the data heap, which in not limited in size, except by how much physical RAM memory you have.  You can allocate from any heap you like, or even make independent heaps.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Parent/Child Task"$
$ID,2$Often a task will $LK,"Spawn","MN:Spawn"$() or $LK,"PopUp","MN:PopUp"$() a task as a helper.  The helper is known as a Child Task, though you can $FG,2$Spawn$FG$ a task and assign it a different parent... like $FG,2$Adam$FG$.  Links are kept as to who spawned what so when one task is $LK,"Kill","MN:Kill"$()ed the helper tasks disappear, too.  You can get a report on current system tasks with $LK+S,"TaskRep","MN:TaskRep"$().  There is just one possible window per task, so child tasks are needed.

$ID,-2$$TR,"HolyC"$
$ID,2$The language used by TempleOS is more than $FG,2$C$FG$ and less than $FG,2$C++$FG$.  See $LK,"HolyC","FI:::/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$.  It has the default arg feature of $FG,2$C++$FG$ and uses $FG,2$class$FG$ in place of $FG,2$struct$FG$.  It uses $FG,2$U0,U8,U16,U32,I64$FG$ and $FG,2$I0,I8,I16,I32,I64$FG$ for signed and unsigned integers.  It has a slightly different operator precedence.  See $LK,"OP_precedence","FA:::/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT,OP_precedence"$  It has the $FG,2$PASCAL$FG$-like feature of function calls with no parens, but requires an "$FG,2$&$FG,2$$FG$" when referring to function addresses.

$ID,-2$$TR,"AOT Compile Mode"$
$ID,2$This term to refers to conventional compilation mode.  It is not the preferred mode for this operating system and is discouraged.  $FG,2$.PRJ$FG$ files are compiled to $FG,2$.BIN$FG$ files, skipping $FG,2$.OBJ$FG$ files.  After compiling, you do a $LK,"Load","MN:Load"$() cmd which is available by right-clicking on a link (like from $LK,"Dir","MN:Dir"$()).  There is no $FG,2$main()$FG$ routine.  Instead, statements outside functions are automatically executed upon loading.  There is no way to unload except by killing the task.  To invoke $FG,2$AOT Compiled Mode$FG$, use the $LK,"Cmp","MN:Cmp"$() routine or right-click on a link.  The $FG,2$Kernel$FG$ modules and compiler are made in $FG,2$AOT$FG$ compiled mode and stored in $FG,2$Kernel.BIN.C$FG$ and $FG,2$Compiler.BIN.Z$FG$, respectively.

See $LK-A,"::/TempleOS/Demo/Games/EagleDive.CPP"$ for an example of an $FG,2$AOT$FG$ module.

$ID,-2$$TR,"JIT Compile Mode"$
$ID,2$In just-in-time mode, the compiler allocates objects, code and data, from the heap, incrementally.  This mode is used during cmd line operations.  When you $FG,2$#include$FG$ a file, it is compiled function by function and objects are placed all over in mem.  The $LK,"ExeFile","MN:ExeFile"$() routine is the same as $FG,2$#include$FG$ but can be placed in programs.  $LK,"ExePrint","MN:ExePrint"$() routine will compile and run a string.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Compiler Intermediate Code"$
$ID,2$The compiler generates instructions one step before making actual assembly (machine) language instructions.  This code is reverse polish in nature and can be viewed with $LK,"PTrace","MN:PTrace"$() or $LK,"OTrace","MN:OTrace"$().  The compiler does not "interpret" code, except in the process of optimization.  The assembly language can be viewed when it is compiled with the $LK,"CTrace","MN:CTrace"$() routine, or afterward with $LK,"U","MN:U"$().

$ID,-2$$TR,"Partition/Drive"$
$ID,2$There is no distinction between "partition" or "drive."  They are specified with a single letter from '$FG,2$A$FG$'-'$FG,2$Z$FG$'.

'$FG,2$:$FG$' is the boot drive.

For commands taking a drive letter as an argument, $FG,2$0$FG$ is the current drive.

$ID,-2$$TR,"RedSea File System"$
$ID,2$This is a simple, 64-bit, file system which is, basically, FAT32 with nice fixed-size directory entries and no FAT table, just an allocation bitmap.  Files cannot grow in size.  Directory entries have compressed and uncompressed size and file check-sums.

$ID,-2$$LK,"AutoFile","HI:AutoFile"$
$LK,"Sprite","HI:Graphics/CSprite"$
$LK,"Hash Table","HI:Hash"$
$LK,"Define","HI:Char/Define"$
$LK,"Link Types","MN:LK_FILE"$
$TR,"files_find_mask"$
$ID,2$$LK,"FilesFindMatch","MN:FilesFindMatch"$().  An optional directory plus a list of file name masks, as in $FG,2$/TempleOS/Demo/*.TXT.Z;*.CPP.Z$FG$

See $LK,"FUF_RECURSE","MN:FUF_RECURSE"$, $LK,"ST_FILE_UTIL_FLAGS","MN:ST_FILE_UTIL_FLAGS"$, $LK,"FILEMASK_TXT","MN:FILEMASK_TXT"$, $LK,"FILEMASK_SRC","MN:FILEMASK_SRC"$, $LK,"FILEMASK_AOT","MN:FILEMASK_AOT"$, $LK,"FILEMASK_JIT","MN:FILEMASK_JIT"$, and $LK,"FILEMASK_GRA","MN:FILEMASK_GRA"$.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Filename Extention Types"$

$FG,5$*.???.C$FG$
  Contiguous files--NOT compressed.
$FG,5$*.TXT.Z;*.TXT;*.LOG.Z;*.LOG$FG$
  Text Files

$LK,"FILEMASK_TXT","MN:FILEMASK_TXT"$
$LK,"FILEMASK_SRC","MN:FILEMASK_SRC"$
$LK,"FILEMASK_AOT","MN:FILEMASK_AOT"$
$LK,"FILEMASK_JIT","MN:FILEMASK_JIT"$
$LK,"FILEMASK_GRA","MN:FILEMASK_GRA"$

$ID,-2$$TR,"Naming Convention"$
$ID,2$$FG,5$$FG$The following are rules I stick to.  If you work on the operating system, it'd be good to stick with them for uniformity, but you can do what you like.  Since there are no "$FG,2$namespaces$FG$" and I don't plan to implement name spaces, I highly recommend putting a 2-3 character module code prefix on syms. e.g. "WS","Doc","Lex"

$FG,5$ALL_CAPS$FG$
  Assembly Language labels are capitalized with underscores between words.  So are $FG,2$#define$FG$'s.

$FG,5$_ALL_CAPS$FG$
  Asm routines which are $LK,"HolyC","FI:::/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ callible should have a leading underscore.

$FG,5$MixedCaps$FG$
  $LK,"HolyC","FI:::/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ Functions and class names are MixedCaps.

$FG,5$lower_case$FG$
  Local function vars and glbl vars are lower case.  Class member names are also lower_case.

$FG,5$_lower_case$FG$
  Function args which are outputs (passed as ptrs) have leading underscores.  Also, args which have identically named local variable counterparts have leading underscores. 

$FG,5$DOCf_????$FG$
  Flags bit nums instead of bit values are designated with a lower case "$FG,2$f$FG$".

$FG,5$DOCG_????$FG$
  Flag groups are designated with "$FG,2$G$FG$".

"$FG,5$result$FG$" is reserved for local variables that hold the function return val.

$FG,5$*$FG$ I used C++ like naming.  I place "New", "Del", "Init", "Rst", ect. on the end of a function name instead of at the beginning.  "$FG,2$RstMusicSettings$FG$" should be "$FG,2$MusicSettingsRst$FG$".

$ID,-2$$TR,"Fs"$
$ID,2$The CPU FS segment register.  This register points to the current task's $LK,"CTask","MN:CTask"$.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Gs"$
$ID,2$The CPU GS segment register.  This register points to the $LK,"CCPU","MN:CCPU"$.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Bt,Bts,Btr,Btc,LBts,LBtr,LBtc"$
$ID,2$These are bit manipulation functions named after x86 instructions.  They stand for "Bit Test", "Bit Test and Set", "Bit Test and Reset" and "Bit Test and Compliment".  An $FG,2$'L'$FG$ means locked with an ASM lock prefix.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Cli,Sti"$
$ID,2$Turn on or off interrupts.  They are named after the x86 instructions.  "Cli" turns off interrupts.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Heap"$
$ID,2$Programs can dynamically request chunks of memory allocated from a "heap" using $LK,"MAlloc","MN:MAlloc"$().  They must $LK,"Free","MN:Free"$() it when finished.  Ptrs are used to refer to it.  The "heap" is dynamically allocated mem.

$ID,-2$$TR,"Root"$
$ID,2$The base of a binary tree or the head of a queue is the root.  (I don't like the word "head.")

$ID,-2$$TR,"Join"$
$ID,2$When two parts of a program have a common low-level routine, that routine is often labeled SomethingJoin.

$ID,-2$$TR,"user_data"$
$ID,2$Many operating system structures have space set aside for you to store values.  You are on your own managing these with multiple applications and libraries.

$ID,-2$$TR,"BSP/AP"$
$ID,2$The "boot-strap processor" is core#0, has the Adam task, and is the master.  The "application processors" have Seth tasks and are the slave processors.  Only the BSP processor's tasks can have windows.
$ID,-2$
