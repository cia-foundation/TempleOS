$FG$
There are a few places where I cut corners in the interest of not junking-up code.  This is part of the TempleOS mentality.  I try not to let, often stupid, legacy compatibility issues enter and junk-up TempleOS.

* I made my type-casting operator post-fix because it makes the compiler way cleaner.

* TempleOS does not figure-out $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ short name alias numbers.  $LK,"FAT32DirNew","MN:FAT32DirNew"$().  It can cause hard drive corruption, so I might have to do it.  It would really take a lot of junky code for this hatefully, detestable, legacy issue.  "Please don't make me ruin my beautiful shiny-new TempleOS with that!"  I am also not enthused about $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ because it is in patent limbo.  $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ might get removed from TempleOS.  There is a TempleOS native, 64-bit, file system that works perfectly well.  $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ is useful, however, because it assists in transferring between dual booted operating systems.

* I changed the $LK,"asm opcodes","FI:::/TempleOS/Compiler/OpCodes.TXT"$ names to remove the ambiguity between instructions with different numbers of arguments, making my $LK,"assembler","FI:::/TempleOS/Compiler/Assembler.CPP"$ simpler and I did minimal 16-bit asm support, since 64-bit is what you should be using, unless you're doing a $LK,"boot loader","FI:::/TempleOS/Adam/Boot/BootCD.CPP"$.

* There are no file-sharing locks of any kind.  You're on your own.
