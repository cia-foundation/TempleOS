$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Linux TSZ Utility"$$FG$


$FG,2$TSZ [-ascii] filename$FG$

Will uncompress a single file from within Linux.  The $FG,2$-ascii$FG$ flag will convert the irregular TempleOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  (ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)


$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Windows TSZ Utility"$$FG$

$FG,2$TSZ$FG$ will uncompress TempleOS files you have gotten to Windows.  There are two ways to get files from TempleOS to Windows -- via CD-ROM or via a $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ partition.


$FG,2$TSZ [-ascii] dirname$FG$:

will uncompress all TempleOS files with names ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$" in a Windows directory and in all subdirectories.  The $FG,2$-ascii$FG$ flag used in combination will convert the irregular TempleOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  (ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)  Note: If you pick names not ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$", they will not need to be uncompressed.  You can $LK,"Move","MN:Move"$() or $LK,"Copy","MN:Copy"$() them to a name not ending in "$FG,2$.Z$FG$" and they will be stored uncompressed.
