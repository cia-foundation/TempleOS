$FG,5$$WW,1$$TX+CX,"TempleOS Charter"$$FG$

TempleOS is God's official temple.  God said to use 640x480 16 color graphics and God said to have a single audio voice.  That is just like how He specified cubits in the Bible! 
 
1) TempleOS is $FG,2$ring-0-only$FG$, running everything in kernel mode including applications.  You have full access to memory, I/O ports, instructions, etc. at all times, because that's fun.

2) TempleOS will always $FG,2$identity-map$FG$ memory in a $FG,2$single-address-map$FG$ configuration.  (Virtual addresses are always kept equal to physical addresses with a single map for all tasks on all cores.)  It's as though paging is not used.

3) TempleOS will always be for one platform -- $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"x86_64","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"$$FG$ PC compatibles.

4) TempleOS will never have networking, so malware is less of an issue.

5) TempleOS will always have one video mode, $FG,2$640x480$FG$ by 16 colors, unless that mode becomes unavailable on computers in the future.

6) TempleOS will always just have PC Speaker sound.

7) TempleOS will always be $FG,2$free$FG$.  I might sell applications, support, or, possibly, do adware.

8) TempleOS will always be $FG,2$100% open source$FG$ with all source included, unless device drivers or something can only be included with non-disclosure agreements.

9) All function args and returns will be 64-bit.  No plans for C++.

10) TempleOS documents are not for printing.  They're dynamic and intended for the screen.  There will always be just one font, a fixed-width font.  No Unicode, just "8-bit ASCII".

11) TempleOS is not for multimedia.  Games will be created by programmers, not artists.  Sounds and images will be, primarily, calculated in real-time, not fetched.

12) All functions, variables and class members will be accessible.  There are no C++ $FG,2$public$FG$/$FG,2$private$FG$ protections and all functions, even secondary ones in the kernel, can be called.

13) $FG,4$$BK,1$Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed.$FG$$BK,0$  You are safest working with $FG,2$JIT$FG$ compilation instead of $FG,2$AOT$FG$ binaries because I can add members to classes, reorder members in classes, add default args to existing functions, change $FG,2$#define$FG$ values, etc. all without breaking compatibility.
