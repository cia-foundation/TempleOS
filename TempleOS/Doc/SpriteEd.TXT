Order of elements matters.  They are executed in the order they appear in the side-bar.  You can set the current element by clicking the element in the side-bar and making it RED.

DELETE will delete the RED element in the side-bar.  You can just delete elements directly in the side-bar as long as you click another element to update things.

You can delete or select elements graphically.

You can insert an element which shifts around all subsequent other elements.  Perhaps, you inserted a sprite's elements from the clip-board and want to chift it around.  This command is also useful if you interpolate in programs.
