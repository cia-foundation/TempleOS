$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Upgrading TempleOS"$$FG$

To upgrade, you generally boot the new TempleOS CD/DVD, install on top of your partition, modify your files and set it to boot your account by executing $LK,"MakeOSPrtBootInstall",A="MN:MakeOSPrtBootInstall"$().  Often, your code will have to be modified to work with the new version.  See $LK,"ChangeLog",A="FI:::/Doc/ChangeLog.TXT"$.  You might have to boot an alternate partition or the CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

The $FG,2$INSTALL$FG$ option when you boot a CD will install on top of an existing install if you tell it not to reformat.

See the $LK,"Installing",A="FI:::/Doc/Install.TXT"$ documentation.
