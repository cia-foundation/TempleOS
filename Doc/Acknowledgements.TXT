1) The font, $LK,"::/Kernel/Font8x8.CPP"$, is taken from $FG,4$$TX,"FreeDOS",HTML="http://www.freedos.org"$$FG$.

2) $LK,"::/Kernel/Dsk/ATADef.HPP"$ originally
from Linux.  I later got the spec.

3) The heap algorithm, $LK,"::/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP"$, is adapted from one I saw at Ticketmaster when I worked on their VAX operating system.

4) The LZW compression algorithm, $LK,"::/Kernel/Compress.CPP"$, came from a magazine and I implemented it when I worked for Ticketmaster.

5) The adaptive-step-size-Runge-Kutta algorithm, $LK,"::/Adam/MathODE.CPP"$, is adapted from the book, $UL,1$Numeric Recipies in C$UL,0$.

6) The random number generator is from the book, $UL,1$Numeric Recipies in C$UL,0$.

7) Tne sheep and goats in AfterEgypt are from $FG,4$$TX,"http://www.public-domain-photos.com",HTML="http://www.public-domain-photos.com"$$FG$.

8) The $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ file system is owned by MicroSoft.

9) A few features were inspired by $FG,2$MATLAB$FG$, such as $FG,2$ans$FG$ in expressions at the command-line.  There is a lot of $FG,2$MSDOS$FG$ , $FG,2$Windows$FG$, $FG,2$VAXTMOS$FG$ (VAX Ticketmaster O.S.) and $FG,2$Unix$FG$ inspiration, too, such as drive letters, command names, etc.

10) I included $LK,"PCIDevice Lst File",A="FI:::/Misc/PCIDevices.TXT",HTML="http://www.pcidatabase.com/reports.php?type=tab-delimeted"$.

11) Thanks to whoever wrote this $FG,4$$TX,"CppHtml.CPP.Z",HTML="http://web.archive.org/web/20100325153025/http://home.scarlet.be/zoetrope/cpphtml.htm"$$FG$.  I'm a novice on web stuff and you helped me with html.  See $LK,"ToHtml",A="FI:::/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP"$.

12) I used $FG,4$$TX,"MagicISO",HTML="http://www.magiciso.com"$$FG$ to burn test CD's to help me understand the ISO9660 file system format.  I mostly used the $FG,4$$TX,"ISO9660",HTML="http://users.telenet.be/it3.consultants.bvba/handouts/ISO9960.html"$$FG$ spec.

13) I looked at bootable CD boot sects, but didn't learn anything, finding it easier to make my own.

14) I think I got my original PC speaker code from $FG,2$Borland C$FG$.

15) I found PS/2 keyboard and mouse code on the net and documentation.  My code is very different.  I found VGA reg info on the net.

16) Thanks to $FG,4$$TX,"http://www.osdev.org",HTML="http://www.osdev.org"$$FG$ for a couple tips.

17) God told me to stick with 640x480 16 color,  a single audio voice and kept me from zombie-walking into making child windows like $FG,2$Windows$FG$.  Instead, I made one window per task with no child windows.  He also guided my progress, very obviously.

18) I got $FG,4$$TX,"Webster's Dictionary",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/files/DICTIONARY.TXT"$$FG$ and $FG,4$$TX,"The King James Bible",HTML="http://www.templeos.org/files/BIBLE.TXT"$$FG$ from $FG,4$$TX,"Project Gutenberg",HTML="http://promo.net/pg/"$$FG$.

In short, I wrote every one of the $TX,"120,838",D="DD_TEMPLEOS_LOC"$ lines myself, no $FG,2$GPL$FG$ code, no linkage or dependence on other code.  Anyone who says otherwise is being an ass.
