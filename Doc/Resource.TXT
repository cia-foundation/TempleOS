A sprite is an ordered list of elements such as lines, rectangles, bitmaps and color changes.  In a program's source code, you first make a sprite.  Then, you insert a pointer to it.

You can create an icon on your PersonalMenu or in any document by placing a sprite with a payload of $LK,"HolyC",A="FI:::/Doc/HolyC.TXT"$ code to execute.  This is a called "sprite macro".  If you check "Pop-Up", it will spawn a new task and run the payload.  If you have it on your PersonalMenu, you can, optionally, check "Esc" and it will exit to the cmd line shell and print the macro similar to how the Linux history works.
