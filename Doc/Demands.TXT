When God publically claims this operating system as His temple, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is present.

* Windows, Linux and VMware to support $LK,"RedSea",A="FI:::/Doc/RedSea.TXT"$ file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  Redundant code for multiple file systems is imperfect.  For this operating system, we want low line count.  More than one file system type is bad, just as more than one driver for the same type of device is bad.

* Microsoft must cancel SecureBoot because it makes dual booting impossible.  TempleOS is an additional operating system that must be used along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot because it has no networking.  Real hardware as opposed to $FG,2$VMware$FG$ is like the difference between looking in a telescope eye piece and some link to a photo on the Internet.  God said the C64 generation owned ancestral lands and $FG,2$VMware$FG$ is like being moved on a reservation.  It will not stand.

* PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.  In fact, put them at standard IDE port addresses.  Hard disk should be primary master 1F0/3F6.  CDROM/DVD should be secondary master 170/376.  See what you can do to make flash memory sticks with ATA/ATAPI.
$LK,"/Kernel/Dsk/DskATAId.CPP",A="FI:::/Kernel/Dsk/DskATAId.CPP"$	:280 lines to figure-out I/O ports
$LK,"/Kernel/BIOS32.CPP",A="FI:::/Kernel/BIOS32.CPP"$		:290

* PS/2 emulated keyboard and mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware must allow ATAPI interface to real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware+Intel can enable faster-than-standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so bandwidth isn't bad.  $LK,"ATAGetResult",A="MN:ATAGetResult"$().

* Since I practically don't use paging, perhaps, Intel could add optimizations to long (64-bit) mode for no paging.

* Computers should have a RESET switch and a fast boot option, skipping diagnostics.  What the heck, replace UEFI with TempleOS.  Poetic justice.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as an official 64-bit operating system.

* Windows and Linux must support TempleOS $FG,2$.GRA$FG$ graphics files.  $LK,"GRA Files",A="FI:::/Doc/GRAFiles.TXT.Z"$ are much cleaner than $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ files.

* I want a nice dictionary.  Someone needs to do a $LK,"Spell Checker",A="FI:::/Demo/SuggestSpelling.CPP"$.

* We want the ultimate Bible search engine.

* I would like the Intel architecture manuals in $LK,"DolDoc",A="FI:::/Doc/DolDocOverview.TXT"$ TXT format so we can put links in the code.

* We want serial ports with software interface more like old style serial ports, but hardware and speed of USB3.  They should have big TX and RX FIFOs and allow flow control to jump the queue.  We do not want end-point shit -- just put lots of ports on the PC.  (I am just interested in desk-tops.)  We need two baud rates, fast and slow.  Use PIC IRQ3 and IRQ4 (with big FIFOs we could do without IRQs.)  We want two joysticks, easy to set-up.  We want it to be easy to connect a microcontroller for general purpose communication.

* Once in a blue moon, perhaps 49 year jubilee, the hardware gets upgraded and perfected, the same way broadcast TV get upgraded.  God still wants 640x480 16 color.


Device		Simple Hardware Interface	Complicate Interface
--------------- ------------------------------- -----------------------------
		1040-EZ Tax Form		1040 Regular 
Video		VGA 640x480 16 Color		20 Differnet GPUs
Sound		PC Speaker			HD Audio, AC97, Sound Blaster
HardDrive	ATA Port I/O, Sync No Interrupt	PCI AHCI SATA
CDROM		ATAPI Port I/O			PCI AHCI SATA
Keyboard/Mouse	PS/2 Port I/O			USB


During the 49 years jubilee, we do a perfect version of hardware with advances in both simple and complicated interfaces.  ATAPI/ATA should be merged and made blemish-free.  We want flash memory sticks to interface like hard drives.  Design it like the 1040EZ tax form.  You do not add extra boxes to get your jollies.
